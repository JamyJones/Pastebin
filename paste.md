## Summary: How CMake Works<br>
---
**Explanation:**

**1**<br>
CMake is a cross-platform build system that automates the process of building, testing, and packaging software. It generates native build files for various operating systems and compilers, such as Unix Makefiles, Visual Studio project files, and Xcode project files.<br>
---
**2**<br>
CMake uses configuration files, called `CMakeLists.txt`, which contain instructions and settings for the build process. These files specify the source files, compiler options, libraries, and dependencies required to build the software.<br>

The CMake build process typically involves three main steps:

- **Configuration**: In this step, CMake reads the `CMakeLists.txt` files and generates build files for the chosen build system (e.g., Makefiles, Visual Studio project files). The configuration step is performed by running the `cmake` command in the project's root directory.

- **Build**: In this step, the native build tool (e.g., `make`, `msbuild`, or `xcodebuild`) uses the generated build files to compile and link the source code, producing the final executable or library.

- **Installation**: (optional) In this step, the built software is installed to a specified location, typically the system's default installation directory or a custom directory specified by the user.

**Example:**

Here's a simple example of a `CMakeLists.txt` file for a C++ project:

```cmake
cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.10)    # Specify the minimum required version of CMake
project(MyProject)                      # Define the project name

set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD 11)              # Set the C++ standard to C++11

add_executable(MyExecutable main.cpp)   # Specify the executable target and source file
```

**Explanation of Code Snippets:**

1. `cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.10)`: This line sets the minimum required version of CMake for the project. If the installed version of CMake is lower than the specified version, the build process will fail.

2. `project(MyProject)`: This line defines the name of the project. CMake uses this name for various purposes, such as naming the build files and generating project-specific settings.

3. `set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD 11)`: This line sets the C++ standard to C++11. The `CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD` variable controls the C++ standard used by the compiler.

4. `add_executable(MyExecutable main.cpp)`: This line specifies the executable target and the source file(s) needed to build the executable. In this example, the target is named `MyExecutable`, and the source file is `main.cpp`.
