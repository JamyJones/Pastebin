## Summary: Using `patchelf` to Change the Interpreter/Linker for `libc.so` <br>
---<br>
Explanation:<br>
1<br>
To change the interpreter/linker for a given shared library (`.so`) to refer to the new `libc.so`, you can use the `patchelf` tool. `patchelf` is a utility for modifying ELF binaries. It allows you to change the interpreter, RPATH, and other properties of ELF binaries.<br>
---<br>
2<br>
First, ensure you have `patchelf` installed on your system. You can install it using your package manager. For example, on a Debian-based system, you can use:<br>
```bash
sudo apt-get install patchelf
```
---<br>
3<br>
Next, use the `patchelf` command with the `--set-interpreter` option to change the interpreter for your shared library. The interpreter is typically the dynamic linker (`ld-linux.so`). Here is the command to change the interpreter to use the new `libc.so`:<br>
```bash
patchelf --set-interpreter /path/to/new/libc.so /path/to/your/shared/library.so
```
Replace `/path/to/new/libc.so` with the actual path to your new `libc.so` file and `/path/to/your/shared/library.so` with the path to your shared library.<br>
---<br>
4<br>
After running the command, you can verify the change by using the `ldd` command to check the dependencies of your shared library:<br>
```bash
ldd /path/to/your/shared/library.so
```
This should show the new `libc.so` as the interpreter.<br>
---<br>
Example:<br>
Suppose you have a shared library `libexample.so` and you want to change its interpreter to a new `libc.so` located at `/home/user/new_libc.so`. You would run the following command:<br>
```bash
patchelf --set-interpreter /home/user/new_libc.so /home/user/libexample.so
```
Then, verify the change with:<br>
```bash
ldd /home/user/libexample.so
```
