## Summary
To learn how V2Ray works, you'll want to explore its architecture, configuration, and the protocols it supports.

### Overview of V2Ray
V2Ray is a versatile network tunneling tool that helps users bypass internet censorship and improve privacy. It is often used in conjunction with other tools to create a more secure browsing experience.

### Key Components
- **Core**: The main engine that handles all the operations.
- **Protocols**: V2Ray supports various protocols like VMess, VLess, and Shadowsocks, which are essential for establishing secure connections.
- **Configuration**: Understanding how to configure V2Ray is crucial. It uses JSON format for its configuration files, which define how the tool operates.

### How V2Ray Works
1. **Connection Establishment**: V2Ray creates a secure tunnel between the client and the server. This is done using the specified protocol (e.g., VMess).
2. **Traffic Routing**: Once the connection is established, V2Ray can route traffic through different paths, allowing users to access blocked content.
3. **Obfuscation**: V2Ray can obfuscate traffic to make it harder for ISPs and firewalls to detect and block it.

### Example Configuration
Hereâ€™s a simple example of a V2Ray configuration file:

```json
{
  "inbounds": [
    {
      "port": 1080,
      "protocol": "socks",
      "settings": {
        "auth": "noauth",
        "udp": true
      }
    }
  ],
  "outbounds": [
    {
      "protocol": "vmess",
      "settings": {
        "vnext": [
          {
            "address": "your_server_address",
            "port": 10086,
            "users": [
              {
                "id": "your_uuid",
                "alterId": 64
              }
            ]
          }
        ]
      }
    }
  ]
}
```
- **Inbounds**: This section defines how V2Ray receives traffic. In this case, it listens on port 1080 using the SOCKS protocol.
- **Outbounds**: This section defines how V2Ray sends traffic out. Here, it uses the VMess protocol to connect to a specified server.
