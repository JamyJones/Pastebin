The symbol `__aeabi_memcpy` is typically found in the context of embedded systems and is part of the ARM architecture's ABI (Application Binary Interface). It is used for memory copying operations, particularly in environments where standard library functions may not be available or suitable.

## Summary
The symbol `__aeabi_memcpy` is associated with memory copying in ARM architecture.

### Explanation:
- **What is `__aeabi_memcpy`?**
  - It is a low-level function used to copy memory from one location to another. This function is optimized for performance on ARM processors.

- **Where is it defined?**
  - This symbol is usually found in the ARM runtime libraries, specifically in the `libgcc` library, which provides low-level support for the C and C++ languages.

- **Why is it used?**
  - It is used in scenarios where developers need to perform memory operations efficiently, especially in embedded systems where resources are limited.

### Example:
If you are programming in C for an ARM-based system, you might not directly call `__aeabi_memcpy`, but it could be invoked by higher-level functions like `memcpy`. For instance:

```c
#include <string.h>

void copy_memory(char *dest, const char *src, size_t n) {
    memcpy(dest, src, n); // This may internally call __aeabi_memcpy
}
```
