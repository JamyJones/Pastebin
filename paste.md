## Summary: Difference Between OpenJDK and JRE and Whether JRE Can Be Installed Without JDK
---
**OpenJDK** and **JRE** are separate components related to Java software development and execution. While they are connected, they serve different purposes. Yes, it is possible to install only the JRE without the full JDK, depending on your use case.

### Explanation:

1. **What is OpenJDK?**
   OpenJDK (Open Java Development Kit) is an **open-source implementation** of the Java Standard Edition (Java SE) specification. It contains:
   - Compiler (**javac**) for translating Java source code into bytecode.
   - Tools such as `javadoc`, `jarsigner`, etc.
   - JVM (Java Virtual Machine) for executing Java bytecode.
   - Libraries and development tools necessary for building, debugging, and running Java applications.

   OpenJDK is primarily meant for **software developers** who need to write and compile Java programs.

2. **What is JRE?**
   JRE (Java Runtime Environment) is a **runtime-only environment for Java**. It is a subset of the JDK designed for users who only want to run Java applications and not develop them. It includes:
   - A **JVM (Java Virtual Machine)** to run Java applications.
   - **Core class libraries** for Java programs to function.
   - Supporting configuration files, browser plugins (deprecated in modern browsers), and profiling tools for running Java apps.

   **What’s Missing in JRE?**
   The JRE does not include:
   - Development tools like the Java compiler (`javac`).
   - Other tools required to write or build Java applications.

   JRE is intended for **end-users** who simply want to execute Java-based programs.

3. **Differences Between OpenJDK and JRE**
   The core differences between OpenJDK and JRE can be summarized as follows:

   | **OpenJDK**                       | **JRE**                          |
   |-----------------------------------|----------------------------------|
   | Complete development environment | Runtime environment only        |
   | Includes development tools       | Does not include development tools |
   | Aimed at developers              | Aimed at users who run Java apps |
   | Requires more storage space      | Requires less storage space      |

4. **Can JRE Be Installed Without JDK?**
   Yes, you can install JRE without needing the full JDK. This is common in situations where:
   - You only want to **run Java programs**, not develop or compile them.
   - The system or application you are using explicitly asks for only a JRE.

   **However**:
   - Many modern tools and frameworks (e.g., IDEs like IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, build tools like Maven) require JDK instead of JRE because they rely on development tools provided by the JDK.
   - **As of Java 9 and higher**, the modularization (through the project “Jigsaw”) blurred the lines between JDK and JRE. Oracle stopped providing a standalone JRE for commercial use. Instead, installing a JDK includes the necessary runtime functionality.

---

### Example:
Let’s consider a situation where you only want to run a Java application (e.g., Minecraft or a Java-based server). You can install a **runtime-only JRE**.

- For OpenJDK environments, you might look for platforms such as:
  - **Amazon Corretto** (JRE bundled with OpenJDK).
  - OpenJDK distributions that provide a modular installation where runtime components can be separated from the full JDK.

If the application requires the full JDK, you would need to install it instead.
