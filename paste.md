## Summary: Preference for Capacitor over Cordova for Android Development <br>
---<br>
Capacitor and Cordova are both frameworks used for building mobile applications using web technologies. However, many developers are increasingly favoring Capacitor for various reasons. Below are the key factors contributing to this preference.

1  
---  
**Modern Architecture**  
Capacitor is designed with a more modern architecture compared to Cordova. It allows developers to build applications using the latest web standards and technologies. Capacitor supports native functionality out of the box, which means developers can easily access native device features without needing extensive plugins. This modern approach makes it easier to maintain and scale applications.

**Better Integration with Frameworks**  
Capacitor integrates seamlessly with popular front-end frameworks like React, Angular, and Vue.js. This integration allows developers to leverage the strengths of these frameworks while building mobile applications. Cordova, while also compatible with these frameworks, often requires additional configuration and setup, making Capacitor a more straightforward choice for many developers.

**Active Development and Community Support**  
Capacitor is actively maintained by the Ionic team, which ensures that it stays up-to-date with the latest trends and technologies in mobile development. The community around Capacitor is growing, providing a wealth of resources, plugins, and support. In contrast, Cordova has seen a decline in active development, which can lead to challenges in finding support and updates.

**Improved Performance**  
Capacitor applications tend to have better performance compared to those built with Cordova. This is largely due to Capacitor's ability to use native views and components, which can lead to a more responsive user experience. Cordova applications often rely on web views, which can introduce performance bottlenecks.

**Easier Plugin Development**  
Capacitor makes it easier to create custom plugins for accessing native functionality. The plugin development process is more straightforward, allowing developers to write native code in Swift, Java, or Kotlin and easily integrate it with their web application. Cordova's plugin system can be more complex and less intuitive, which can deter developers from creating custom solutions.

**Example:**  
For instance, if a developer wants to access the device's camera, using Capacitor, they can simply call the `Camera` API provided by Capacitor without needing to install additional plugins or configure complex settings. In contrast, with Cordova, the developer might need to install a specific camera plugin and handle various configurations, which can be cumbersome.
