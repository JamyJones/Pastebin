## Why People Prefer Capacitor to Cordova for Android Development <br>
---<br>
Explanation: Capacitor and Cordova are both frameworks used to build mobile applications using web technologies. However, many developers have started to prefer Capacitor over Cordova for several reasons. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of the differences and advantages:

1  
Capacitor is designed to be a modern replacement for Cordova. It enables developers to build cross-platform applications using JavaScript, but it also leverages the native capabilities of mobile platforms effectively.

- **Modern Architecture**: Capacitor has a more modern architecture, providing a more intuitive and lightweight approach to building apps.
- **Native Plugin System**: Capacitor includes a powerful and flexible plugin system that allows developers to create and use native plugins much more easily than Cordova.

Easier Integration with Modern Frameworks: Capacitor was designed with modern web development in mind.

- **Support for Latest Frameworks**: Capacitor integrates seamlessly with popular frameworks like React, Angular, and Vue, making it more appealing to developers who are already using these technologies.
- **Hot Reloading**: It supports hot reloading, which allows developers to see changes to their app in real-time as they code.

Better Debugging and Testing Experience: Capacitor offers improved debugging capabilities.

- **Live Reload**: The live reload feature synchronizes changes to the app instantly, enabling faster testing and development.
- **Enhanced Debugging Tools**: Capacitor provides developer-friendly debugging tools which can lead to a smoother development process compared to Cordova.

Example: A developer building a hybrid mobile application for Android using **Capacitor** might use the following commands to create a new project:

```bash
# Install Capacitor
npm install @capacitor/core @capacitor/cli

# Initialize a new Capacitor project
npx cap init

# Add the Android platform
npx cap add android

# Build the project based on any changes made
npx cap build
```

Each command allows for efficient setup and management of the application, leveraging the advantages of Capacitor's streamlined processes.
