### Summary
Micro-fracturing in bones and growth after puberty are two distinct topics. Micro-fracturing is a medical procedure that can stimulate bone healing and cartilage growth, but it does not increase height. Growth after puberty is generally limited due to the closure of growth plates, but slight changes in height can occur with improved posture, spinal health, and weight management.

### Explanation
#### Micro-fracturing in Bones
Micro-fracturing is a surgical technique used to treat damaged cartilage. It involves creating small fractures in the bone to stimulate the body's natural healing response, leading to the formation of new cartilage. However, this procedure does not increase the length of the bone or height.

#### Growth After Puberty
Puberty is the period during which most growth in height occurs. Once puberty ends and the growth plates (epiphyseal plates) close, further height increase is generally not possible. Growth plates typically close by the ages of 16-18 for females and 18-21 for males. However, slight changes in height can occur with improved posture, spinal health, and weight management.

### Example
For instance, a person who maintains good posture and exercises regularly to keep their spine healthy may appear taller due to reduced spinal compression.
