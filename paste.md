## Summary
The buffer size of `ffplay` can be adjusted using various command-line options to optimize performance and reduce latency.

## Explanation
`ffplay` is a simple media player that uses the FFmpeg libraries. By default, `ffplay` uses a buffer size to manage data flow, but this can be modified to suit specific needs.

### Key Options to Adjust Buffer Size
1. **`-probesize`**: Sets the size of the probe buffer. This is used to determine the format of the input data.
2. **`-analyzeduration`**: Sets the maximum duration (in milliseconds) to analyze the input data.
3. **`-max_delay`**: Sets the maximum delay (in milliseconds) between the input and output.
4. **`-rtbufsize`**: Sets the real-time buffer size (in bytes).

### Example Usage
To reduce latency, you might use the following command:
```sh
ffplay -probesize 100000 -analyzeduration 100000 -max_delay 0 -rtbufsize 1000000 input.mp4
```
This command sets the probe buffer size, analyzeduration, max delay, and rtbufsize to 100000 bytes, which can help reduce the delay.
