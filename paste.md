## What Can Pydub Do? <br>
---

Pydub is a Python library designed for audio processing tasks and manipulating audio files. It provides a simple and user-friendly API for various audio-related operations, making it accessible for developers at all skill levels. Below are some of the capabilities and features that Pydub offers:

1. **Audio File Manipulation**  
   Pydub allows users to perform various operations such as:
   - **Reading and Writing** audio files in different formats (MP3, WAV, etc.).
   - **Splitting and Merging** audio files effortlessly.
   - **Changing Audio Length** by trimming or concatenating files.
  
   Example:
   ```python
   from pydub import AudioSegment

   # Load an audio file
   sound = AudioSegment.from_file("example.mp3")
   # Export sound to a different format
   sound.export("output.wav", format="wav")
   ```

2. **Volume Adjustment**  
   Users can easily manipulate the audio volume by adjusting the gain:
   - **Increase or Decrease Volume** through simple operations.
   - **Normalization** can also be done to ensure consistent volume levels across different audio segments.

   Example:
   ```python
   # Increase volume by 10 dB
   louder_sound = sound + 10
   ```

3. **Audio Effects**  
   Pydub provides several built-in effects:
   - **Fade in and Fade out** effects.
   - **Reverse audio** segments.
   - **Apply noise reduction** and other manipulations to enhance audio quality.

   Example:
   ```python
   # Fade in for 2 seconds and fade out for 3 seconds
   faded_sound = sound.fade_in(2000).fade_out(3000)
   ```

4. **Audio Playback**  
   Pydub can play audio directly from code:
   - It supports playback using the simple `play` function, requiring additional installations like `pyaudio` for sound playback.

   Example:
   ```python
   from pydub.playback import play
   play(sound)  # Plays the AudioSegment
   ```

5. **Format Conversion**  
   Converts audio files between different formats easily.
   - For example, converting MP3 files to WAV and vice-versa, or to other supported formats.

   Example:
   ```python
   sound.export("output.mp3", format="mp3")  # Convert to mp3
   ```

6. **Advanced Techniques**  
   Pydub supports advanced features:
   - **Overlaying sounds** to combine multiple audio tracks.
   - **Analyzing audio with additional libraries** for tasks like amplitude and frequency analysis.

   Example:
   ```python
   # Overlay two audio segments
   overlapped = sound1.overlay(sound2)
   ```

7. **Integration with Other Libraries**  
   Works seamlessly with libraries like `ffmpeg` or `libav`, enabling more advanced audio manipulations, such as encoding and flexible format handling.

   Installation:
   To use Pydub, you'll need to install it alongside `ffmpeg` or `libav`:
   ```bash
   pip install pydub
   ```
   Additionally, ensure you have ffmpeg installed on your system for format conversions.
