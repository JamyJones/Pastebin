## Summary: Moving from Java Console Apps to Android Development<br>
---<br>
**Explanation:**

1<br>
---
**Understand the Basics Thoroughly:**
If you feel like you're stuck in "tutorial hell," it may be due to not fully grasping the basics. Spend extra time understanding core Java concepts such as Object-Oriented Programming, inheritance, polymorphism, and data structures. A strong foundation will make the transition to Android development smoother.

2<br>
---
**Build Small Projects:**
Instead of following tutorials, work on small, simple projects that interest you. This hands-on practice will reinforce what you've learned and build confidence. You can start with mini console applications like a calculator, a to-do list, or a basic game.

3<br>
---
**Use Documentation and Online Resources:**
Familiarize yourself with Java documentation and online forums like Stack Overflow or Reddit. Reading documentation helps you understand how to use different libraries and APIs effectively.

4<br>
---
**Practice Problem-Solving:**
Practice coding problems on platforms like LeetCode, HackerRank, or CodeSignal. This not only strengthens your programming skills but also prepares you for real-world problem-solving.

5<br>
---
**Join a Community:**
Join online communities or local meetups where you can interact with other learners and developers. Being part of a community provides support, motivation, and valuable insights.

6<br>

**Gradually Transition to Android Development:**
Once you're comfortable with Java, start learning Android development. Follow official Android documentation and create small Android projects. Understand how Android Studio works, how to use XML for layout design, and get familiar with Android components like activities, fragments, and services.

**Example:**

```java
// Example: Simple Java Console App (To-Do List)
import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.Scanner;

public class ToDoList {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        ArrayList<String> tasks = new ArrayList<>();
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        
        while (true) {
            System.out.println("To-Do List:");
            for (int i = 0; i < tasks.size(); i++) {
                System.out.println((i + 1) + ". " + tasks.get(i));
            }
            System.out.println("Choose an option: \n1. Add Task \n2. Remove Task \n3. Exit");
            int choice = scanner.nextInt();
            scanner.nextLine(); // Consume newline

            if (choice == 1) {
                System.out.print("Enter a new task: ");
                String task = scanner.nextLine();
                tasks.add(task);
            } else if (choice == 2) {
                System.out.print("Enter the task number to remove: ");
                int taskNumber = scanner.nextInt();
                if (taskNumber > 0 && taskNumber <= tasks.size()) {
                    tasks.remove(taskNumber - 1);
                }
            } else if (choice == 3) {
                break;
            }
        }
        scanner.close();
    }
}
```
