## Configuring Compiler for Static Linking with Older gLibc Versions
---
To compile your program in a way that it statically includes all required symbols, specifically from the GNU C Library (glibc), you need to take a series of corrective steps. Simply using `-static-libgcc` and `-static-libstdc++` will not include glibc statically since this is compiled with the dynamic linking approach by default.

### Static Linking with GNU Compiler Collection (GCC)
---
1. **Understand the Static vs. Dynamic Linking**:
   - **Static Linking**: Combines all necessary library functions into the final executable at compile time, resulting in a self-contained binary.
   - **Dynamic Linking**: Uses shared libraries loaded at runtime, which may lead to compatibility issues on older systems.

2. **Install a Static Version of glibc**:
   - Most distributions do not provide a statically linked version of glibc due to size and legal reasons. Consider using alternative libraries like **musl** or compile glibc yourself as a static library.
   - Example command to install **musl** might look like this:
     ```bash
     sudo apt-get install musl-tools
     ```

3. **Compile with Static Link Flag**:
   - Use the `-static` flag to compile your executable. This tells the compiler to link against static libraries instead of dynamic ones.
   - Example command to compile might look like this:
     ```bash
     gcc -static -o my_program my_program.c
     ```
   - This fully instructs GCC to link everything statically.

4. **Additional Flags**:
   - For including static libraries explicitly, you can add:
     ```bash
     LDFLAGS="-static -Wl,--whole-archive -lc -Wl,--no-whole-archive"
     ```
   - This tells the linker to include the entire specified library and not discard any symbols.

5. **Check for Missing Dependencies**:
   - As you compile, make sure that any additional libraries your project depends on are also available in static form.

### Example Code
---
```bash
# Compile your C file with static linking
gcc -static -o my_program my_program.c
```
- This command will generate a binary called `my_program` with all dependencies linked statically, if available.

### Considerations
---
- Keep in mind that not all executables will work perfectly if linked statically with glibc due to its reliance on dynamic features.
- Testing on target systems is crucial to ensure compatibility.

### Conclusion
By specifying the right flags and ensuring the availability of static libraries, you can create a binary that operates on older versions of glibc without dependency issues. However, always consider checking licensing requirements and potential increase in binary size.
