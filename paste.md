## Summary: How Android WebView Determines the Web Engine to Use<br>
---
Android's **WebView** is a component that allows developers to display web content as part of their apps. It leverages a web engine to render and execute web pages. The choice of the web engine is not something that developers or users explicitly configure; instead, it is determined by Android's platform implementation and updates. This explanation outlines **how WebView determines which web engine to use** and the factors involved.

## Explanation: How Android WebView Chooses Its Web Engine<br> 

### 1. **WebView is Based on Chromium**  
Starting from Android 4.4 (KitKat), WebView is built on Chromium. Chromium is an open-source web browser project that forms the foundation of several major web browsers, including Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge (new versions), and others. 

- The version of Chromium used depends on the version of Android running on the device or the installed WebView implementation.

- The WebView component is based on the Android System WebView package, which integrates the Chromium web engine to display and render HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

---

### 2. **Android System WebView**  
The Android operating system uses a component called **Android System WebView** to update the web engine it relies on. This package is:
- **Standalone**: Starting with Android 5.0 (Lollipop), WebView was separated from the system and became an *updatable APK* on the Google Play Store.
- **Updated via Google Play**: Since it's an independent library, users can receive updates to the WebView component (including Chromium updates) without waiting for a full system update.

---

### 3. **Default Web Engine Selection**  
The WebView uses the system's **default WebView implementation**. This is influenced by:
- **Android Version**: Each Android release bundles a specific version of the Chromium engine.
- **Manufacturer's Changes**: Some phone manufacturers may customize how the WebView behaves (e.g., Samsung Internet).
- **WebView Provider Configuration**: On some devices, users or developers can check or override the WebView provider in **Developer Options**. For example:
  - Default WebView options might include **Android System WebView** or **Google Chrome** (in cases where Chrome can act as a WebView provider—for example, Android 7.0 Nougat and onwards).

You can verify or change the WebView provider in **Settings > Developer Options > WebView Implementation (or WebView Provider)**.

---

### 4. **How WebView Accesses the Engine?**
When interacting with WebView in code (`android.webkit.WebView`), the system automatically routes requests to the installed WebView package (which contains the Chromium web engine). Key points:
- **Developers don’t choose the engine directly**—this is abstracted and handled by the WebView component tied to the system or updates installed by the user.
- **Backward Compatibility**: If needed, developers can restrict their WebView's behavior for compatibility with older Android versions, but the underlying engine (Chromium) remains the same.

## Example: Setting Up and Using WebView in Android<br>

Here’s a practical example of how a WebView gets initialized in code. While the *web engine to use* (Chromium) is determined automatically, developers need to call the WebView and configure settings.

### Code Example
```java
// Importing the necessary classes
import android.os.Bundle;
import android.webkit.WebView;
import android.webkit.WebViewClient;
import androidx.appcompat.app.AppCompatActivity;

public class MainActivity extends AppCompatActivity {
    
    @Override
    protected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
        super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);
        
        // Initializing a WebView instance
        WebView webView = new WebView(this);
        
        // Setting the WebView as the main content view
        setContentView(webView);
        
        // Enabling JavaScript and other web settings
        webView.getSettings().setJavaScriptEnabled(true);

        // Setting a WebViewClient to handle navigation within the app
        webView.setWebViewClient(new WebViewClient());

        // Loading a website
        webView.loadUrl("https://www.google.com");
    }
}
```

#### Explanation:
1. **`WebView webView = new WebView(this);`**
   - Creates a new WebView instance. The default WebView implementation (with Chromium) is automatically referenced.

2. **`setContentView(webView);`**
   - Replaces the activity's main content with the WebView instance to render web content.

3. **`webView.getSettings().setJavaScriptEnabled(true);`**
   - Enables JavaScript in the WebView. This needs to be enabled manually, as it is disabled by default for security reasons.

4. **`webView.setWebViewClient(new WebViewClient());`**
   - Ensures URLs clicked within the WebView open in the WebView rather than a browser. This makes navigation seamless within the app.

5. **`webView.loadUrl("https://www.google.com");`**
   - Loads the specified URL into the WebView.

## Key Takeaways:
- **Chromium** is the web engine used by Android WebView. It ensures compatibility and modern web standards.
- **WebView updates** rely on the Android System WebView package, which is decoupled from the OS starting from Android Lollipop.
- The web engine used is **tied to the installed WebView implementation** on the system or selected in Developer Options (if available).
- Developers interact with **WebView's API** and are abstracted from engine-level details.
