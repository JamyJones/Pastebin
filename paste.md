## Summary
Static `.deb` packages can be quite large due to the inclusion of all dependencies and libraries required for the software to run independently.

## Explanation
1. **Dependencies Included**: Static `.deb` packages contain all the necessary dependencies and libraries within the package itself. This means that even if multiple applications require the same library, each application will have its own copy of that library within the package.
2. **No Shared Libraries**: Unlike dynamic linking, where shared libraries are used by multiple applications, static linking includes copies of all libraries within the package. This increases the size of the package significantly.
3. **Self-Contained**: Static packages are self-contained, meaning they do not rely on external libraries or dependencies that need to be installed separately. This makes installation easier but at the cost of increased size.
4. **Compatibility**: Including all dependencies ensures that the software will work on any system without requiring additional installations or updates to the system libraries.

## Example
Consider a simple C program that statically links the `math` library. The resulting `.deb` package will include the entire `libm` library, even if other programs on the system also use `libm`.

Does this help clarify why static `.deb` packages are so large?
