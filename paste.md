## Summary: Understanding and fixing the error "CANNOT LINK EXECUTABLE: cannot locate symbol"

This error typically occurs in **Android Native Development Kit (NDK)** or C++ code compiled for Android when there is a mismatch or compatibility issue related to system libraries (e.g., `libstdc++`, `libc++_shared`, etc.) or ABI (Application Binary Interface) settings. The symbol `_ZTTNSt6__ndk` refers to a mangled name in **C++ standard library**, often caused by linking or runtime issues with the proper standard C++ library.

---

## Explanation:

### 1. Understanding the error message:
- **`CANNOT LINK EXECUTABLE`:**
  This indicates that the app or executable fails to link properly when running on the target device because it's missing a symbol.
- **`cannot locate symbol "_ZTTNSt6__ndk1...`:**
  The mangled name here points to an issue with the standard library (likely with `std::basic_istringstream`).
- **`referenced by...`:**
  This indicates that a specific dependency or location in your code is dependent on this symbol, and it couldn't be resolved by the linker.

### 2. Causes of the error:
- **NDK Library Mismatch:** Android NDK provides multiple C++ libraries like **libstdc++**, **libc++**, or **gnustl**. You may be using an incompatible library or the symbol isn’t found in the provided versions.
- **ABI Incompatibilities:** The binary may have been built with an ABI (e.g., `armeabi-v7a`) but is being linked with another (e.g., `arm64-v8a`).
- **C++ Standard Mismatch:** The code might require C++11, C++17, or later features, but you're building with an incorrect or older C++ standard.
- **Inconsistent Runtime Linking:** For example, if you use `libc++_shared.so` during compilation but it's missing or replaced at runtime, you can see this error.
- **Overwriting or Dynamic Linking Issues:** If your app mixes shared libraries (`.so` files) compiled with different C++ runtimes, unresolved symbols can appear.

### 3. Steps to Fix the Error:

#### A) Correct Configuration in `CMakeLists.txt`:
Ensure you're using the correct C++ Standard Library (`libc++`) and set it explicitly in your project’s `CMakeLists.txt`:
```cmake
set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD 17)  # Use C++11 or C++17 explicitly
set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD_REQUIRED ON)

# Set libc++ as the C++ runtime library
set(CMAKE_SHARED_LINKER_FLAGS "${CMAKE_SHARED_LINKER_FLAGS} -stdlib=libc++")
```
- **Why?**
  This ensures the compiler and linker use the correct `libc++` runtime, aligning with Android NDK's recommendations.

---

#### B) Check NDK Configuration in `gradle.properties` (if you’re using NDK with Gradle):
Add necessary flags to specify the correct ABI and standard library:
```properties
android.useDeprecatedNdk=true  # If using older libraries (optional)

# Specify NDK ABI Filters (ensure universal support)
ndk {
    abiFilters 'armeabi-v7a', 'arm64-v8a'
}

# Use appropriate STL (Standard Template Library)
externalNativeBuild {
    cmake {
        cppFlags "-std=c++11 -frtti -fexceptions"
        arguments "-DANDROID_STL=c++_shared"
    }
}
```
- **Why?**
  This ensures consistent ABI and C++ runtime usage across builds.

---

#### C) Eliminate ABI Mismatch:
Verify that all native libraries (`.so` files) you’re bundling are built for the same ABI. For example:
- Check directories under `app/src/main/jniLibs/` (e.g., `arm64-v8a`, `armeabi-v7a`).
- Ensure libraries match the `app/build.gradle` configuration.

Forcing specific ABIs in `gradle.properties` can prevent runtime mismatches.

---

#### D) Ship Correct `.so` Files:
Ensure that `libc++_shared.so` (used by the Android NDK when linking against `libc++`) is bundled inside your APK and deployed to the right path (`/lib/<ABI>/`).

- **Add in CMakeLists.txt:**
```cmake
find_library(cpp_library c++_shared)
target_link_libraries(your_target PRIVATE ${cpp_library})
```
- **Why?**
  Ensures the runtime library is shipped with your app.

---

#### E) Rebuild Project Using Latest NDK:
1. Update to the latest Android NDK version (e.g., r25 or later).
2. Clean and rebuild the entire project. Use:
   ```bash
   ./gradlew clean
   ./gradlew assembleDebug
   ```

---

#### F) Debugging for Specific Symbols:
To investigate which library misses the symbol `_ZTTNSt6__ndk119basic_istringstream...`, you can:
1. **Demangle the symbol** to find what it represents:
   Use `c++filt`:
   ```bash
   echo "_ZTTNSt6__ndk119basic_istringstreamIcNS_11char_traitsIcEENS_9allocatorIcEEEE" | c++filt
   ```
   Output: `typeinfo for std::__ndk1::basic_istringstream<char, std::__ndk1::char_traits<char>, std::__ndk1::allocator<char>>`

2. **Examine shared library symbols**:
   Use `nm` or `objdump` to list and verify symbols in your `.so` files:
   ```bash
   nm -C libyourlibrary.so | grep basic_istringstream
   ```
3. **Log Missing Symbol at Runtime**:
   Use Android’s `logcat` to trace where in your application the issue arises:
   ```bash
   adb logcat | grep "CANNOT LINK EXECUTABLE"
   ```

---

### Example Fix:
If the issue stems from using `libstdc++` instead of `libc++`, update your CMakeLists.txt like this:
```cmake
# Specify C++ Standard
set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD 17)
set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD_REQUIRED ON)

# Link libc++
find_library(cpp_library c++_shared)
target_link_libraries(your_target PRIVATE ${cpp_library})

# Ensure compatibility with Android NDK
add_compile_options(-D_GLIBCXX_USE_CXX11_ABI=0)
```

---

### Final Steps:
- Rebuild and re-test your application on the target device.
- Include logs or further debugging steps if the error persists.
