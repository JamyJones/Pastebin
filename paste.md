**Explanation:** 

When providing information or explanations, my responses are structured to ensure clarity and detail. Here’s how I follow your instructions:

---

**1. Accurate and Detailed Information:** 
  - I ensure the information provided is accurate, detailed, and up-to-date.
  - I verify the information before sharing it to ensure it aligns with what you've asked for.

---

**2. Code Explanation:** 
  - I break down code snippets and explain each line.
  - I include the purpose of built-in methods or keywords, their respective modules, and how they work.
  - I state any necessary imports and explain why each line of code is written in a specific way.

---

**Example:**

Let's say you asked for an explanation of a Python code snippet:

```python
import math  # Importing the math module to use mathematical functions

def calculate_area(radius):
    """Calculates the area of a circle given its radius."""
    return math.pi * radius ** 2  # Using math.pi to get the value of Pi and calculate the area

# Calling the function with a radius of 5
area = calculate_area(5)
print(f"The area of the circle is: {area}")
```

- `import math`: Imports the math module, which contains mathematical functions and constants.
- `def calculate_area(radius):`: Defines a function named `calculate_area` that takes a parameter `radius`.
- `"""Calculates the area of a circle given its radius."""`: A docstring that describes what the function does.
- `return math.pi * radius ** 2`: Uses `math.pi` to get the value of Pi (π) and calculates the area of the circle using the formula πr².
- `area = calculate_area(5)`: Calls the `calculate_area` function with a radius of 5 and stores the result in the variable `area`.
- `print(f"The area of the circle is: {area}")`: Prints the calculated area of the circle.
