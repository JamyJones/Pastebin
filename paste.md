## Summary
Understanding the output of the command `nm -D libc.so | grep __aeabi_memcpy`

### Explanation:
The command you ran is used to list symbols from the shared library `libc.so` and filter the results for the `__aeabi_memcpy` symbols. Here’s a breakdown of the command and its output:

1. **Command Breakdown**:
   - `nm`: This command is used to list symbols from object files. In this case, it’s being used on a shared library (`libc.so`).
   - `-D`: This option tells `nm` to display dynamic symbols, which are used for dynamic linking.
   - `libc.so`: This is the standard C library in Linux, which contains essential functions for C programming.
   - `|`: This is a pipe that takes the output of the command on the left (`nm -D libc.so`) and uses it as input for the command on the right (`grep __aeabi_memcpy`).
   - `grep __aeabi_memcpy`: This filters the output to show only lines that contain the string `__aeabi_memcpy`.

2. **Output Explanation**:
   - The output you received consists of two types of symbols: `W` and `T`.
     - `W`: This indicates a weak symbol. Weak symbols can be overridden by strong symbols of the same name. In your output, `__aeabi_memcpy`, `__aeabi_memcpy4`, and `__aeabi_memcpy8` are weak symbols.
     - `T`: This indicates a global symbol that is in the text (code) section of the library. The symbols `__aeabi_memcpy`, `__aeabi_memcpy4`, and `__aeabi_memcpy8` are defined here as global functions.

3. **Symbol Functions**:
   - `__aeabi_memcpy`: This is a function used for memory copying in ARM architecture. It is part of the ABI (Application Binary Interface) for ARM and is optimized for performance.
   - The suffixes `4` and `8` indicate that these functions are optimized for copying 4-byte and 8-byte data types, respectively.

### Example:
If you were to use these functions in your code, you might see something like this:
```c
#include <string.h>

void example() {
    char src[10] = "Hello";
    char dest[10];
    __aeabi_memcpy(dest, src, 6); // Copies 6 bytes from src to dest
}
```
In this example, `__aeabi_memcpy` is used to copy data from `src` to `dest`.
