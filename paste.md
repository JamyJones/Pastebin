## Summary
The provided C code retrieves and displays the group name associated with the current process's group ID using the `getgrgid_r` function. 

---

### Explanation:

1. **Header Files**  
   ```c
   #include <stdio.h>
   #include <grp.h>
   #include <unistd.h>
   ```
   - `#include <stdio.h>`: This header file is included for input and output functions, such as `printf` and `perror`.
   - `#include <grp.h>`: This header file is necessary for working with group information, including the `struct group` and the `getgrgid_r` function.
   - `#include <unistd.h>`: This header file provides access to the POSIX operating system API, including the `getgid` function.

2. **Main Function and Variable Declarations**  
   ```c
   int main() {
       gid_t gid = getgid();
       struct group grp;
       char buffer[1024];
       struct group *result;
   ```
   - `int main()`: The entry point of the program.
   - `gid_t gid = getgid();`: This line retrieves the current process's group ID and stores it in the variable `gid`.
   - `struct group grp;`: Declares a variable `grp` of type `struct group`, which will hold the group information.
   - `char buffer[1024];`: Allocates a buffer of 1024 bytes to hold the group name and other information.
   - `struct group *result;`: Declares a pointer to a `struct group`, which will be used to check if the retrieval of group information was successful.

---

3. **Retrieving Group Information**  
   ```c
   if (getgrgid_r(gid, &grp, buffer, sizeof(buffer), &result) == 0 && result != NULL) {
       printf("Group Name: %s\n", grp.gr_name);
   } else {
       perror("getgrgid_r failed");
   }
   ```
   - `getgrgid_r(gid, &grp, buffer, sizeof(buffer), &result)`: This function retrieves the group information for the given group ID (`gid`). It fills the `grp` structure with the group details, uses `buffer` for temporary storage, and sets `result` to point to the `grp` structure if successful.
     - The function returns `0` on success.
     - `result != NULL` checks if the group information was successfully retrieved.
   - `printf("Group Name: %s\n", grp.gr_name);`: If successful, this line prints the group name stored in `grp.gr_name`.
   - `perror("getgrgid_r failed");`: If the function fails, this line prints an error message indicating the failure.

---

4. **Return Statement**  
   ```c
   return 0;
   ```
   - This line indicates that the program has completed successfully.

---

### Example:
To compile and run this code, you can use the following commands in a terminal:
```bash
gcc -o get_group_name get_group_name.c
./get_group_name
```
This will display the group name associated with the current process's group ID.
