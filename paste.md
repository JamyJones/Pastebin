## Summary
The error message "CANNOT LINK EXECUTABLE: can't read file . is a directory" typically occurs when there is an issue with the way dependencies are linked or when the path specified is incorrect after using `patchelf`.

### Explanation

1. **Understanding `patchelf`**: 
   - `patchelf` is a command-line utility used to modify the dynamic linker and RPATH of ELF executables. It allows you to change the dependencies of an executable without recompiling it.
   - When you replace a dependency, you need to ensure that the new path is correct and points to a valid file.

2. **Common Causes of the Error**:
   - **Incorrect Path**: If the path you provided to `patchelf` points to a directory instead of a file, you will encounter this error. Make sure that the path to the new library is correct and that it points to a specific file.
   - **Missing Permissions**: Ensure that the executable has the necessary permissions to read the new library. You can check permissions using `ls -l <path_to_library>`.
   - **Library Compatibility**: The new library must be compatible with the executable. If there are ABI (Application Binary Interface) mismatches, it can lead to linking errors.

3. **Troubleshooting Steps**:
   - Double-check the path you provided to `patchelf`. Use an absolute path to avoid confusion.
   - Verify that the library file exists and is not a directory. You can use `file <path_to_library>` to confirm.
   - Check the permissions of the library file and the executable. Use `chmod` to adjust permissions if necessary.
   - If you suspect the library might be incompatible, try reverting to the original dependency and see if the executable runs without issues.

### Example
If you used the command:
```bash
patchelf --set-rpath /path/to/new/library my_executable
```
Make sure `/path/to/new/library` is a valid path to a shared library file (e.g., `libmylibrary.so`) and not a directory.
