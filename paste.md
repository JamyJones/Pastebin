**Types of Internet Censorship**  
- **Government Censorship**: Many governments impose restrictions on internet access to control the flow of information. This can include blocking access to social media platforms, news websites, or any content deemed inappropriate or threatening to the state.
- **Corporate Censorship**: Companies may censor content on their platforms to comply with local laws or to maintain a certain brand image. This can involve removing user-generated content or restricting access to specific topics.
- **Self-Censorship**: Individuals may choose to censor themselves due to fear of repercussions, such as legal action or social ostracism. This often occurs in environments where freedom of expression is limited.

**Methods of Internet Censorship**  
- **IP Blocking**: This involves preventing access to specific IP addresses associated with websites. When a user tries to access a blocked site, they receive an error message instead.
- **DNS Filtering**: This method alters the Domain Name System (DNS) to prevent users from resolving the domain names of blocked websites. Users may be redirected to a different page or receive a "not found" message.
- **Content Filtering**: This technique uses software to analyze and block specific content based on keywords or phrases. It is commonly used in schools and workplaces to restrict access to inappropriate material.

**Impacts of Internet Censorship**  
- **Freedom of Expression**: Censorship can significantly limit individuals' ability to express their opinions and access diverse viewpoints, leading to a homogenized information landscape.
- **Access to Information**: Censorship can hinder access to vital information, including news, educational resources, and health information, which can have serious implications for society.
- **Innovation and Creativity**: A restricted internet can stifle innovation and creativity, as individuals may be less likely to share ideas or collaborate freely.

**Example**:  
A notable example of internet censorship is China's "Great Firewall," which blocks access to numerous foreign websites, including Google, Facebook, and Twitter. The Chinese government employs various methods, such as IP blocking and content filtering, to control the information available to its citizens.
