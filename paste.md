## Summary: Debugging a Bash Script for Excluding Files
---  
This script is meant to read dependency names from a build script in a specified package, skip certain scripts from being processed based on exclusions, and append new content to the 'build.sh' files. However, it has an issue where it does not skip the file when it's supposed to.

### Identifying the Issue
The issue lies within the `if` condition where you check if a dependency is in the `exclude_these_script` array. The usage of `[[ "${exclude_these_script[@]}" =~ " $dep_ " ]]` is incorrect for checking if an item is in an array. Instead, it should compare the elements properly.

### Fixing the Condition
To properly check if `dep_` is contained within the `exclude_these_script` array, you can utilize a loop or an appropriate check. Here's an updated version on how to implement this:

```bash
for dep_ in "${dep_array[@]}"; do
  dep_=$(echo "$dep_" | xargs) #remove white space from beginning
  # Initialize a flag to check if we should skip
  skip=false
  
  # Loop through each exclusion
  for excluded in "${exclude_these_script[@]}"; do
    if [[ "$excluded" == "$dep_" ]]; then
      skip=true
      break
    fi
  done
  
  if $skip; then
    continue
  fi
  
  find_exact_path=$(find "./packages/$dep_" -type f -name "build.sh")
  build_script_paths+=("$find_exact_path")
done
```
In this adjustment, we have:
- Initialized a `skip` variable to `false`.
- Looped through `exclude_these_script` to set `skip` to `true` if a match is found.
- Used `continue` to skip the rest of the loop if `skip` is `true`.

### Finalizing Script Execution
Once you've restructured the exclusion check, your script should appropriately skip adding the specified `build.sh` file paths, and then successfully append the contents as intended.

```bash
for p in "${build_script_paths[@]}";do
  echo "$add_script" >> "$p"
done
```
This part of the code remains unchanged and will iterate over the valid build script paths to append the necessary script block.

---  
### Example: Test with Sample Data
To see if your updated script works correctly, you could test it by creating a sample directory structure:
```bash
mkdir -p ./packages/fontconfig
echo 'TERMUX_PKG_DEPENDS="libx11"' > ./packages/fontconfig/build.sh

mkdir -p ./packages/libx11
echo 'TERMUX_PKG_DEPENDS="libxext"' > ./packages/libx11/build.sh

mkdir -p ./packages/libxext
echo 'TERMUX_PKG_DEPENDS=""' > ./packages/libxext/build.sh

# Call your script with `fontconfig` as input.
```
This way, when you run your updated script, it will check dependencies correctly and skip `fontconfig` while processing the others.
