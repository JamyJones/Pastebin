## Configuring Compiler for Static Linking with Older glibc Versions
---  
To ensure that your application can run on systems with older versions of glibc, you can configure your compiler to statically link all necessary symbols. This process involves using specific flags during the compilation and linking stages. Below are the steps and explanations for achieving this.

1  
---  
**Understanding Static vs. Dynamic Linking**  
- **Static Linking**: This process includes all the necessary library code into the final executable at compile time. This means that the executable does not depend on the presence of shared libraries on the target system.
- **Dynamic Linking**: In contrast, dynamic linking relies on shared libraries (like glibc) being present on the target system at runtime.

**Compiler Flags for Static Linking**  
To statically link your application, you typically use the `-static` flag with the GCC (GNU Compiler Collection). Here’s how you can do it:

```bash
gcc -static -o my_program my_program.c
```
- `gcc`: This is the GNU Compiler Collection command.
- `-static`: This flag tells the compiler to link against static libraries instead of shared ones.
- `-o my_program`: This specifies the output file name for the compiled program.
- `my_program.c`: This is your source code file.

**Including All Symbols**  
To ensure that all symbols are included, you may also want to use the `-Wl,--whole-archive` option. This option forces the linker to include all object files from the specified static libraries. Here’s an example:

```bash
gcc -o my_program my_program.c -Wl,--whole-archive -l<library_name> -Wl,--no-whole-archive
```
- `-Wl,`: This prefix tells GCC to pass the following options to the linker.
- `--whole-archive`: This option includes all symbols from the specified library.
- `-l<library_name>`: Replace `<library_name>` with the actual library you want to link statically.
- `--no-whole-archive`: This option stops the whole archive mode, allowing subsequent libraries to be linked normally.

**Considerations**  
- **Dependencies**: Ensure that all libraries you are linking against have static versions available (usually with a `.a` extension).
- **Size**: Statically linked binaries can be significantly larger than dynamically linked ones because they include all the necessary library code.
- **Compatibility**: Test your statically linked binaries on the target systems to ensure compatibility with older glibc versions.

Example:  
Here’s a complete example of compiling a simple C program with static linking:

```bash
gcc -static -o my_program my_program.c -Wl,--whole-archive -lm -Wl,--no-whole-archive
```
In this example, `-lm` links the math library statically.
