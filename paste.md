## Why Are Static DEB Packages So Huge?
---
**Explanation:**
1. **Dependencies Included:**
   Static DEB packages often include all the dependencies required for the software to run. This ensures that the software can run on any system without needing to download additional libraries or dependencies. However, this also means that the package size increases significantly as it includes multiple libraries and dependencies.

2. **Library Duplication:**
   In static DEB packages, libraries are often duplicated across different packages. Each package includes its own copy of the required libraries, leading to larger package sizes. This is in contrast to dynamic linking, where libraries are shared among different packages, reducing the overall size.

3. **Comprehensive Functionality:**
   Static DEB packages are designed to provide comprehensive functionality out of the box. This means they include all the necessary components, plugins, and modules to ensure the software works as intended. While this is convenient for users, it also contributes to the larger size of the packages.

4. **Compatibility:**
   Static DEB packages are built to be compatible with a wide range of systems and configurations. To achieve this, they often include multiple versions of libraries and dependencies to ensure compatibility with different environments. This adds to the overall size of the package.

5. **Security:**
   Including all dependencies within the package can enhance security by ensuring that the software uses known and trusted versions of libraries. This reduces the risk of vulnerabilities associated with using outdated or untrusted libraries. However, this also means that the package size increases as it includes all the necessary security components.

**Example:**
Imagine you have a software application that requires several libraries to function. If you create a static DEB package for this application, you would include all the required libraries within the package itself. This ensures that the application can run on any system without needing to download additional libraries. However, this also means that the package size will be larger compared to a dynamic package that relies on shared libraries.
