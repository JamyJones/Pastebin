## Summary
Pydub is a powerful audio manipulation library in Python that allows you to work with audio files easily. One of its capabilities includes overwriting sections of an audio file with new audio files.

### Explanation

Pydub provides a simple interface for audio manipulation. To overwrite sections of an audio file, you typically follow these steps:

1. **Importing the Library**  
   You need to import the `AudioSegment` class from the `pydub` module. This class is essential for loading and manipulating audio files.
   ```python
   from pydub import AudioSegment
   ```

2. **Loading Audio Files**  
   You can load your original audio file and the new audio file that you want to insert. Pydub supports various audio formats like WAV, MP3, etc.
   ```python
   original_audio = AudioSegment.from_file("original.mp3")
   new_audio = AudioSegment.from_file("new_audio.mp3")
   ```

3. **Overwriting Sections**  
   To overwrite a specific section, you need to define the start and end times (in milliseconds) of the section you want to replace. You can then slice the original audio and concatenate it with the new audio.
   ```python
   start_time = 10000  # 10 seconds
   end_time = 20000    # 20 seconds

   # Slicing the original audio
   before_section = original_audio[:start_time]
   after_section = original_audio[end_time:]

   # Concatenating the audio segments
   modified_audio = before_section + new_audio + after_section
   ```

4. **Exporting the Modified Audio**  
   Finally, you can export the modified audio back to a file.
   ```python
   modified_audio.export("modified_audio.mp3", format="mp3")
   ```

### Example
Hereâ€™s a complete example that demonstrates how to overwrite a section of an audio file:
```python
from pydub import AudioSegment

# Load the original and new audio files
original_audio = AudioSegment.from_file("original.mp3")
new_audio = AudioSegment.from_file("new_audio.mp3")

# Define the section to overwrite
start_time = 10000  # 10 seconds
end_time = 20000    # 20 seconds

# Slice the original audio
before_section = original_audio[:start_time]
after_section = original_audio[end_time:]

# Create the modified audio
modified_audio = before_section + new_audio + after_section

# Export the modified audio
modified_audio.export("modified_audio.mp3", format="mp3")
```
