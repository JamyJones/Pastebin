## Summary: Causes of Volume Change in FFmpeg

---

### Explanation:

**1. Volume Filter Usage**
- FFmpeg uses the `volume` filter to adjust audio levels. This filter allows you to increase or decrease the volume of an audio stream by specifying a multiplier or decibel value.
- For example:
  ```bash
  ffmpeg -i input.wav -filter:a "volume=1.5" output.wav
  ```
  Here, `volume=1.5` increases the volume by 50%.

---

**2. Encoding and Re-encoding**
- When you apply the `volume` filter, FFmpeg re-encodes the audio stream. This process can lead to changes in the file size, bitrate, or quality, depending on the encoding settings.
- If you want to avoid re-encoding, you can use the `-c:a copy` option, but this will not allow volume adjustments.

---

**3. Normalization and Loudness**
- FFmpeg provides tools for normalizing audio, such as the `loudnorm` filter, which adjusts the perceived loudness of the audio to meet specific standards (e.g., EBU R128).
- Example:
  ```bash
  ffmpeg -i input.wav -filter:a loudnorm output.wav
  ```

---

**4. File Format and Codec Limitations**
- Some audio formats or codecs may not support certain volume adjustments. Ensure that the chosen codec is compatible with the desired changes.

### Example:

To reduce the volume by 5 decibels:
```bash
ffmpeg -i input.wav -filter:a "volume=-5dB" output.wav
```
