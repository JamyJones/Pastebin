## Summary: Fixing the **`CANNOT LINK EXECUTABLE`** error caused by **missing or incompatible symbols**
---
The specific error `CANNOT LINK EXECUTABLE: cannot locate symbol "_ZTTNSt6__ndk119basic_istringstream..."` indicates that a binary or application you're trying to execute cannot find the required **C++ standard library symbol**. This kind of issue arises typically in **Android Native Development (NDK)** projects when there are mismatched or incompatible runtime libraries used in conjunction with the binary.

This mismatch can occur due to one of these reasons:
1. **NDK Version mismatch** - Incompatibility between the application's compiled binary and the runtime library.
2. **Incorrect use or lack of linking with the C++ Standard Library** (`libstdc++`, `libc++`).
3. **Mismatch in ABI versions** for the compiled files.
4. Usage of an **older or custom toolchain** that doesn't align properly with the compiled binary.

Let's break down and explain how to resolve the issue.

---

### 1. **Understanding the Issue**:
The error's key part is:
```plaintext
cannot locate symbol "_ZTTNSt6__ndk119basic_istringstream..."
```
- `_ZTTNSt6__ndk119basic_istringstream` symbolizes a **C++ type mangled function**, specifically related to `std::basic_istringstream` in the NDK's implementation of the C++ Standard Template Library (**STL**).
- The `__ndk1` portion refers to **LLVM libc++**, which Android NDK uses as its default implementation for the C++ standard library.

This suggests:
1. **Your application or library depends on the `libc++` (LLVM libc++), but it might not be fully linked to the correct version of the standard library.** 
2. **An old runtime (e.g., outdated Android device or an older NDK-built binary) is being used.**
3. **Incorrect ABI linking**, meaning the compiled code doesn't match the expected `arm`, `arm64`, `x86`, etc., configurations.

---

### 2. **Possible Solutions**:

#### (a) **Ensure the correct C++ STL runtime is linked**
Ensure that you're linking against the correct standard library in your build configuration. This is primarily done in your `CMakeLists.txt` or `Android.mk`.

For **CMake-based builds**:
```cmake
# Ensure proper linkage with libc++
set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD 11) # or 14/17 based on your requirements
set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD_REQUIRED ON)

set(STD_LIB "c++") # Android NDK uses libc++ by default
set(CMAKE_SHARED_LINKER_FLAGS "${CMAKE_SHARED_LINKER_FLAGS} -stdlib=${STD_LIB}")

# Link libc++
find_library(LIBCXX_LIB c++_shared PATHS ${ANDROID_NDK}/sources/cxx-stl/llvm-libc++/libs/${ANDROID_ABI})

target_link_libraries(${TARGET_NAME} ${LIBCXX_LIB})
```

For applications using **Android.mk**:
```makefile
# Ensure libc++_shared or libc++_static is specified as the STL
APP_STL := c++_shared
APP_PLATFORM := android-21
```

This ensures you're properly linking the **`libc++`** shared library. Alternatively, use `c++_static` if you prefer static linking.

---

#### (b) **Update your Android NDK version**
An **outdated NDK** might be causing incompatibility issues. Always ensure you use a **modern NDK version**. As of now (2023), versions like **r25 and above** are stable and widely adopted.

- You can update the NDK in **Android Studio**:
  Go to **SDK Manager > SDK Tools > NDK > Select the latest version**.
- Alternatively, download the latest NDK from Google's [official NDK site](https://developer.android.com/ndk/downloads).

Once updated, rebuild the native libraries to ensure they're compatible.

---

#### (c) **Verify ABI compatibility**
Mismatch in **ABI (Application Binary Interface)** can also cause this error if you’re trying to run a binary compiled for one architecture (e.g., `arm64-v8a`) on a device or emulator designed for another (e.g., `armeabi-v7a`).

Steps:
1. Specify the correct **ABI** in your `build.gradle` or `CMakeLists.txt`.
   Example:
   ```gradle
   ndk {
       abiFilters 'arm64-v8a', 'armeabi-v7a'
   }
   ```
   or in `CMakeLists.txt`:
   ```cmake
   set(ANDROID_ABI "arm64-v8a")
   ```

2. Verify your device or emulator supports the target ABI.

---

#### (d) **Avoid conflicting native libraries**
Check for conflicts in prebuilt native libraries bundled into the app, especially if the app includes third-party shared libraries. Multiple versions of `libc++_shared.so` can lead to runtime symbol mismatch.

- To ensure a single implementation:
  - Bundle all libraries using **`c++_shared`**, and avoid mixing it with other implementations like `gnustl` or `stlport`.
  - Use a single **toolchain** across the project.

---

#### (e) **Explicitly include required headers**
If the symbol comes from `std::basic_istringstream` in C++, ensure you’ve included the necessary headers to avoid partial or incorrect linking:
```cpp
#include <sstream>
```

---

### 3. **Example Fix in CMake Project:**
If you encountered the error while building a C++-based Android NDK project, implement this:

```cmake
# Specify the C++ standard
set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD 17)
set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD_REQUIRED YES)

# Ensure proper library is used
set(STD_LIB "c++")
set(CMAKE_SHARED_LINKER_FLAGS "${CMAKE_SHARED_LINKER_FLAGS} -stdlib=${STD_LIB}")

# Link against the Android NDK's libc++
find_library(CPP_LIB c++_shared PATHS ${ANDROID_NDK}/sources/cxx-stl/llvm-libc++/libs/${ANDROID_ABI})
find_library(LOG_LIB log)

target_link_libraries(${TARGET_NAME} ${CPP_LIB} ${LOG_LIB})
```
