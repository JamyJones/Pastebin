### Summary
**Drawbacks of using NativeScript for JavaScript HTML5 games**

### Explanation
1. **Performance Issues**: NativeScript apps can sometimes suffer from performance issues, especially on older devices. This can be due to the overhead of running JavaScript on the device's native engine.
2. **Documentation Problems**: The official NativeScript documentation can be too general and sometimes unhelpful, making it difficult for developers to find specific solutions to their problems.
3. **Plugin Reliability**: Some plugins available for NativeScript can be buggy or poorly maintained, which can lead to additional debugging and development time.
4. **Cross-Platform Limitations**: While NativeScript aims to provide a single code base for both iOS and Android, there can still be platform-specific issues that require custom solutions.
5. **Learning Curve**: Developers who are new to NativeScript may find the learning curve steep, especially if they are not already familiar with JavaScript, TypeScript, or Angular.

### Example
For instance, if you encounter a performance issue with a NativeScript game, you might need to profile the app and identify bottlenecks, which can be time-consuming.
