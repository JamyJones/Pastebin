## Summary
Micro-fracturing in bones is a process that involves creating small fractures to stimulate bone growth and healing. This technique is often used in orthopedic surgery to repair damaged cartilage and promote bone regeneration.

## Explanation
1. **Bone Healing Process**: When a bone is fractured, the body initiates a healing process that involves the formation of new bone tissue. This process is regulated by cells called osteoblasts (which build new bone) and osteoclasts (which break down old bone).
2. **Micro-Fracturing Technique**: In micro-fracturing, small fractures are intentionally created in the bone to stimulate the healing process. This technique is often used in conjunction with other treatments, such as the application of bone grafts or growth factors, to enhance bone regeneration.
3. **Impact on Bone Height**: While micro-fracturing can promote bone growth and repair, it is unlikely to significantly increase the height of the bone. The primary goal of micro-fracturing is to stimulate the formation of new bone tissue and improve the strength and stability of the bone, rather than increasing its length.

## Example
In orthopedic surgery, micro-fracturing is commonly used to treat cartilage defects in the knee. By creating small fractures in the bone beneath the damaged cartilage, the body's natural healing response is activated, leading to the formation of new cartilage-like tissue.
