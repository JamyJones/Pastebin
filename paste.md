## Summary  
A robo-advisor is an automated platform that provides financial planning services with minimal human intervention.

### Explanation:  
Robo-advisors use algorithms and technology to manage investments and provide financial advice. Here’s a breakdown of how they work:

- **Automated Investment Management**  
  Robo-advisors create and manage a diversified portfolio based on the user’s risk tolerance, investment goals, and time horizon. They typically use modern portfolio theory to optimize asset allocation.

- **User Input**  
  Users usually start by filling out a questionnaire that assesses their financial situation, investment goals, and risk tolerance. This information helps the robo-advisor tailor a personalized investment strategy.

- **Low Fees**  
  One of the main advantages of robo-advisors is their low fees compared to traditional financial advisors. They often charge a percentage of assets under management (AUM), which can be significantly lower than the fees charged by human advisors.

- **Rebalancing and Tax-Loss Harvesting**  
  Robo-advisors automatically rebalance portfolios to maintain the desired asset allocation. They may also employ tax-loss harvesting strategies to minimize tax liabilities for users.

### Example:  
For instance, if a user indicates a moderate risk tolerance and a goal of saving for retirement in 20 years, the robo-advisor might allocate a mix of stocks and bonds, adjusting the portfolio as market conditions change.
