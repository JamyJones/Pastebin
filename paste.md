## Configuring Compiler for Static Linking with Older glibc Versions
---  
To ensure that your application can run on systems with older versions of glibc, you need to statically link all necessary libraries and symbols. This process can be a bit complex, especially when dealing with C and C++ applications. Below are detailed steps and explanations to help you achieve this.

1

**Understanding Static Linking**  
Static linking involves including all the necessary library code into the final executable at compile time. This means that the executable will not depend on shared libraries at runtime, which is crucial for compatibility with older systems that may not have the required versions of libraries.

**Compiler Flags for Static Linking**  
To statically link your application, you can use the following flags with `gcc` or `g++`:

- `-static`: This flag tells the compiler to link against static libraries instead of shared ones.
- `-static-libgcc`: This flag ensures that the GCC runtime library is statically linked.
- `-static-libstdc++`: This flag ensures that the C++ standard library is statically linked.

You can combine these flags in your compilation command like this:

```bash
gcc -o my_program my_program.c -static -static-libgcc -static-libstdc++
```

**Additional Libraries**  
If you are still encountering missing symbols, it may be due to other libraries that are dynamically linked. You can check which libraries your application depends on using the `ldd` command:

```bash
ldd my_program
```

If you see any libraries listed that are not statically linked, you will need to find their static versions (usually with a `.a` extension) and link them explicitly. For example, if you are using `libm` (the math library), you can add `-lm` to your compile command.

4

**Using a Custom Toolchain**  
In some cases, the default toolchain may not provide static versions of all libraries. You can consider using a custom toolchain that includes static libraries for glibc and other dependencies. Tools like `musl` or `busybox` can be alternatives that provide static linking capabilities.

**Example of a Complete Command**  
Hereâ€™s an example of a complete command that includes static linking for a C program:

```bash
gcc -o my_program my_program.c -static -static-libgcc -static-libstdc++ -lm
```

This command compiles `my_program.c`, linking it statically with the math library and ensuring that both the GCC and C++ standard libraries are included statically.
