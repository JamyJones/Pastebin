Understanding the requirement for `-static-libstdc++` in compiler command line arguments. <br>
---<br>
Explanation: 

1. **What is `-static-libstdc++`?**  
   The `-static-libstdc++` flag is a compiler option used in conjunction with **GCC (GNU Compiler Collection)** when compiling C++ programs. Its primary purpose is to statically link the C++ standard library (libstdc++) into your final executable. This means that instead of the program relying on the shared (dynamic) version of the library that exists on the system where it runs, the entire library is included within the executable itself.

2. **Why use it?**  
   By using this flag, you can ensure that your program is self-contained, which can simplify distribution and deployment. This is particularly useful if you expect your program to be run on systems where the specific version of the C++ library is unknown or where there could be compatibility issues.

3. **Requirements for using `-static-libstdc++`**  
   To use the `-static-libstdc++` flag, you need to have the following installed:
   - **GCC/G++:** Make sure you have the GNU Compiler Collection installed in your development environment.
   - **Static libraries:** The static version of the C++ standard library must be available on your system. In Linux, this is usually installed by default along with the GCC libraries, but you can also ensure it's installed by installing the corresponding package, for example: 
     - For Debian/Ubuntu: `sudo apt install libstdc++-static`
     - For Red Hat/Fedora: `sudo dnf install libstdc++-static`
  
   If you're on Windows and using MinGW, ensure that the `libg++.a` library is available within your installation.

Example:  
Here is a basic example of using `-static-libstdc++` while compiling a C++ program:

```bash
g++ -o my_program my_program.cpp -static-libstdc++
```

In this command:  
- `g++` is the GNU C++ compiler.
- `-o my_program` specifies the output file name for the compiled executable.
- `my_program.cpp` is the input source file you want to compile.
- `-static-libstdc++` tells the compiler to statically link the C++ standard library.
