## Summary: Existence of sects similar to those portrayed in Donghua

---

**Explanation:**

1. **What are Sects in Donghua?**  
   In Donghua (Chinese animated series), sects are often portrayed as organizations or groups dedicated to martial arts, cultivation, or mystical practices. These sects are hierarchical, with masters, disciples, and elders, and they often have unique philosophies, techniques, and rivalries. Examples include sects from popular series like *Battle Through the Heavens* or *A Will Eternal*.

2. **Do Such Sects Exist in Reality?**  
   While the sects in Donghua are fictional and often exaggerated for storytelling, they are inspired by real-world organizations in Chinese history and culture. Historically, there were martial arts schools, Taoist and Buddhist monasteries, and secret societies in China that shared some similarities with these fictional sects. These groups often focused on martial arts training, spiritual cultivation, or philosophical teachings.

   However, the mystical powers and dramatic rivalries depicted in Donghua are purely fictional. Real-world sects or schools were more grounded in practical skills, religious practices, or community-building.

3. **Modern-Day Equivalents:**  
   Today, martial arts schools and spiritual organizations still exist, but they are more structured and regulated. They focus on teaching traditional practices like Kung Fu, Tai Chi, or meditation rather than the fantastical elements seen in Donghua.

**Example:**  
   A real-world example would be the Shaolin Monastery, famous for its martial arts training and spiritual teachings. While it doesn't have the dramatic flair of Donghua sects, it has inspired many fictional portrayals.
