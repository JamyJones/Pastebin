## Summary
The libraries `libjimage.so`, `libjli.so`, `libjq.so`, and `libjsig.so` are part of the Java Development Kit (JDK) and are used for various functionalities within the Java runtime environment.

### Explanation

1. **libjimage.so**
   - **Purpose**: This library is responsible for handling the Java image format, which is used to store Java class files and resources in a single file.
   - **Module**: It is part of the JDK and is typically found in the `lib` directory of the JDK installation.
   - **Usage**: It allows for efficient loading of classes and resources, improving startup time and memory usage.

2. **libjli.so**
   - **Purpose**: This library provides the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) interface for launching Java applications.
   - **Module**: It is also included in the JDK and is essential for the Java launcher.
   - **Usage**: It helps in initializing the JVM and managing the execution of Java applications.

3. **libjq.so**
   - **Purpose**: This library is related to the Java Quickening feature, which optimizes the performance of Java applications.
   - **Module**: It is part of the JDK and is used internally by the JVM.
   - **Usage**: It enhances the execution speed of Java programs by optimizing method calls.

4. **libjsig.so**
   - **Purpose**: This library provides support for Java signal handling, allowing Java applications to respond to system signals.
   - **Module**: It is included in the JDK and is crucial for managing signals like interrupts.
   - **Usage**: It enables Java applications to handle events such as termination requests gracefully.

### Example
For instance, when you run a Java application, `libjli.so` is invoked to start the JVM, which in turn may utilize `libjimage.so` to load the necessary classes and resources efficiently.
