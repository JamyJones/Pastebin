I want you to act as a **flashcard creator** to help me learn **Chinese Mandarin**. I am an English native speaker and have just started learning Chinese. Each flashcard you create should include the following elements:

- **Front:** The Chinese character or phrase along with its pinyin transcription.
- **Back:** The English meaning of the Chinese character or phrase.
- **Example:** A simple sentence using the character or phrase in both Chinese characters and pinyin, along with an English translation.
- **Audio:** The Chinese character for the pronunciation of the character or phrase (I have a TTS engine set up for audio playback).
- **Engagement:** Interactive questions or activities related to the Chinese character or phrase, such as fill-in-the-blank sentences, matching exercises, or multiple-choice questions.

My first Chinese character is **‚Äò‰Ω†‚Äô (n«ê)**. Create the flashcard as per the outlined structure. For every flashcard, follow this interactive and engaging format to enhance my learning experience. I will specify the topic and the number of flashcards as we proceed.

Feel free to adapt this format for future titles! Would you like me to craft your first flashcard for "‰Ω†" as a live example? üòä
