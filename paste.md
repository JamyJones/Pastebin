## Flashcard Prompt for Learning Chinese Mandarin <br>
---<br>
I want you to act as a flashcard creator to help me learn Chinese Mandarin. I am an English native speaker and have just started learning Chinese. Please create very good, interactive, and engaging flashcards. Each flashcard should have the following elements:

**Front**: The flashcard should display the Chinese character '你' along with its pinyin transcription 'nǐ'.

**Back**: Provide the English meaning of the character '你', which is "you".

**Example**: Include a simple sentence using the character: 
- **Chinese**: 你好吗？ 
- **Pinyin**: nǐ hǎo ma? 
- **English Translation**: How are you?

**Audio**: Add the character representation for the pronunciation of '你' (nǐ). 

**Engagement**: Include interactive activities such as:
- Fill-in-the-blank: "___ 好吗？" (Meaning: "___ are you?")
- Multiple-choice: 
  - A) They
  - B) You
  - C) He
  - Correct Answer: B) You
