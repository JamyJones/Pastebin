## How to Use Anki to Learn Chinese
---
**Explanation:**
1. **Anki Overview:** 
   - Anki is a powerful, user-friendly flashcard program that leverages spaced repetition algorithms to enhance long-term memory retention. It's particularly effective for language learning, including Chinese, due to its customizability and accessibility.

2. **Setting Up Anki:**
   - **Download and Install:** Visit the official [Anki website](https://apps.ankiweb.net/) and download the version suitable for your operating system. Follow the installation instructions.
   - **Create an Account:** You can create an AnkiWeb account to sync your progress across devices, which is especially useful if you want to study on both your computer and mobile device.

3. **Creating Flashcards:**
   - **Basic Flashcards:** Start by creating basic flashcards with Chinese characters (Hanzi) on one side and their meanings/pinyin on the other.
   - **Audio and Images:** Enhance your cards by adding audio (native pronunciation) and images. This multimodal approach can help with recognition and pronunciation.

4. **Using Pre-made Decks:**
   - **Download Decks:** Anki has a vast collection of shared decks available. Search for Chinese language decks on AnkiWeb or other community forums.
   - **Modify Decks:** Tailor pre-made decks to fit your learning needs by adding or editing cards.

5. **Spaced Repetition:**
   - **How It Works:** Anki uses an algorithm to schedule review sessions based on how well you remember each card. Cards you know well appear less frequently, while cards you struggle with appear more often.
   - **Daily Practice:** Consistent daily practice is crucial. Spend a few minutes every day reviewing your flashcards.

6. **Advanced Tips:**
   - **Tagging:** Use tags to organize your cards by topic, difficulty, or any other category you find helpful.
   - **Custom Study:** Use the custom study options to focus on cards due for review, new cards, or specific tags.
   - **Add-ons:** Explore Anki add-ons to enhance your learning experience. For example, add-ons for stroke order animations, Chinese sentence mining, or tone practice can be beneficial.

**Example:**
