Explanation: 

A robo-advisor typically operates using algorithms to manage client portfolios based on their risk tolerance, investment goals, and other financial factors. Here’s a breakdown of how they work:

1. **Client Onboarding**  
Robo-advisors begin by gathering information from clients. This usually involves an online questionnaire that assesses the client’s financial status, investment goals, and risk tolerance. This detailed information allows the robo-advisor to tailor a suitable investment strategy for the client.

2. **Algorithm-Based Investment Strategy**  
Once the qualifications are gathered, the robo-advisor uses algorithms to create and manage a diversified investment portfolio. This automation involves several key components:  
   - **Asset Allocation**: The algorithm decides how to distribute the client’s portfolio across various asset classes (stocks, bonds, ETFs, etc.) based on their risk profile and objectives.
   - **Rebalancing**: Over time, market performance can skew the intended asset allocation. Robo-advisors automatically rebalance the portfolio to maintain the originally determined asset allocation.

3. **Low Fees and Accessibility**  
Robo-advisors typically charge lower fees compared to traditional financial advisors as they use technology to minimize human interaction. Many platforms have low or no account minimums, making investing more accessible to a broader range of individuals.

4. **Monitoring and Reporting**  
These platforms continuously monitor client portfolios and provide regular updates and reporting. Clients can usually access their accounts through intuitive online dashboards to view performance metrics, contributions, and other relevant information.

Example: 

Popular robo-advisors include companies like Betterment, Wealthfront, and Robinhood. For example, Betterment uses the client’s input to allocate assets in low-cost ETFs, automatically adjusts based on market conditions, and provides tax optimization strategies to maximize returns.
