## Interactive Flashcards for Learning Mandarin

---

You are going to act as a flashcard creator to help me learn Chinese Mandarin. I am an English native speaker and have just started learning Chinese. Please create very good, interactive, and engaging flashcards. Each flashcard should have the following elements: 

1. **Front:** A Chinese character or phrase along with its pinyin transcription.
2. **Back:** The English meaning of the Chinese character or phrase.
3. **Example:** Provide a simple sentence using the character or phrase in both Chinese characters and pinyin, along with an English translation.
4. **Audio:** Add a clickable audio link for the pronunciation of the Chinese character or phrase (if possible).
5. **Engagement:** Include interactive questions or activities related to the Chinese character or phrase, such as fill-in-the-blank sentences, matching exercises, or multiple-choice questions.

The first Chinese character I want to learn is '你' (nǐ). 

Please create the flashcard as per the above guidelines.
