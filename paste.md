## Summary
The ffmpeg command provided is intended to mix two audio files while adding a delay to one of them. However, it's unclear why it's not working as expected, specifically regarding silencing the original audio or overwriting it.

Your `ffmpeg_command` structure looks correct for mixing audio, but let’s break down the functionality and potential issues. Here’s a line-by-line explanation of your current command:

```python
ffmpeg_command = [
    'ffmpeg',                       # Calls the ffmpeg command-line tool
    '-i', 'input.mp3',             # Specifies the first input audio file
    '-i', 'temp.mp3',              # Specifies the second input audio file
    '-filter_complex',              # Indicates that a complex filter will be used
    f'[1:a]adelay={delay_ms}|{delay_ms} [voice];',  # Delays the second input audio (temp.mp3)
    f'[0:a][voice] amix=inputs=2:duration=longest [audio_out]',  # Mixes the audio from both inputs
    '-map', '[audio_out]',          # Maps the output of the mix to a new output stream
    'output.mp3'                    # Specifies the name of the output file
]
```
In this command:
- The `adelay` filter is used to delay the audio from `temp.mp3` (index 1) by `delay_ms` milliseconds. The syntax `|{delay_ms}` is used to apply the same delay to multiple channels.
- The `amix` filter blends the audio streams together. The parameter `inputs=2` tells `ffmpeg` to mix two inputs, and `duration=longest` specifies that the output audio should last as long as the longest input.

To silence the original audio during the mixing process, you can modify the command. Instead of mixing both audio sources directly, you can mute the original audio and just allow the delayed audio to pass. This can be achieved using the `anull` filter or summing the audio with silence. Here's how you can structure the command:

```python
ffmpeg_command = [
    'ffmpeg',
    '-i', 'input.mp3',
    '-i', 'temp.mp3',
    '-filter_complex',
    f'[0:a]anull[a1]; [1:a]adelay={delay_ms}|{delay_ms}[voice]; [a1][voice] amix=inputs=2:duration=longest[audio_out]',
    '-map', '[audio_out]',
    'output.mp3'
]
```
In this modified example:
- `[0:a]anull[a1]`: The `anull` filter effectively passes the first audio stream (`input.mp3`) without any sound; thus, you can have it muted.
- The mixing is now between the muted audio from `input.mp3` and the delayed audio from `temp.mp3`.

If you want to overwrite the original audio's section instead of just silencing it, you could use the `amerge` filter after you apply the delay to the second audio, but that nuance would require careful management of volumes and streams for exact goals.

To run the command, ensure you have ffmpeg installed and accessible from your command line and execute the command using:

```python
import subprocess
subprocess.run(ffmpeg_command)
```

---  
Example:  
Here is how you can use the modified command in a Python script:

```python
import subprocess

delay_ms = 2000  # example delay in milliseconds

ffmpeg_command = [
    'ffmpeg',
    '-i', 'input.mp3',
    '-i', 'temp.mp3',
    '-filter_complex',
    f'[0:a]anull[a1]; [1:a]adelay={delay_ms}|{delay_ms}[voice]; [a1][voice] amix=inputs=2:duration=longest[audio_out]',
    '-map', '[audio_out]',
    'output.mp3'
]

subprocess.run(ffmpeg_command)
```

This will create an output file called `output.mp3`, containing the second audio from `temp.mp3`, delayed by `delay_ms` milliseconds, while the original audio from `input.mp3` is effectively silenced.
