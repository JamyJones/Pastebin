## Speed of Light <br>
---
**1. Speed in Vacuum:** <br>
The speed of light in a vacuum is precisely **299,792,458 meters per second** (approximately **300,000 kilometers per second** or about **186,282 miles per second**). This speed is a fundamental constant of nature and is denoted by the symbol **c**.

**2. Importance in Physics:** <br>
The speed of light is crucial in many areas of physics, particularly in the theory of relativity. According to Einstein's theory of special relativity, the speed of light is the maximum speed at which all energy, matter, and information in the universe can travel.

**3. Speed in Different Media:** <br>
When light travels through different media, such as water or glass, it slows down. The speed of light in a medium is determined by the medium's refractive index. For example, the speed of light in water is approximately **225,000 kilometers per second**, and in glass, it's around **200,000 kilometers per second**.

**Example:** <br>
If you were to travel at the speed of light, you could orbit the Earth about 7.5 times in just one second!
