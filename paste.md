## Summary:
The error `CANNOT LINK EXECUTABLE: cannot locate symbol` typically occurs in Android applications or native libraries compiled with the Android NDK. It points to an issue where an expected symbol, such as a function or class defined in the C++ standard library (`std` namespace), cannot be found during runtime linking.

This error indicates a mismatch between the app/library's compiled binaries and the libraries or runtime synergies it depends on. Specifically, the missing symbol `_ZTTNSt6__ndk119basic_istringstreamIcNS_11char_traitsIcEENS_9allocatorIcEEEE` refers to the C++ class `std::istringstream`, which is part of the C++ Standard Template Library (STL).

---

### Explanation:

1. **Symbol Mangling and `_ZTT` Representation**:
   - The `_ZTT...` prefix is part of the name mangling used by C++ compilers to ensure uniqueness of symbols.
   - For instance, `_ZTTNSt6__ndk119basic_istringstream...` refers to `std::basic_istringstream<char>` (known simply as `std::istringstream`).
   - This error means that your program expects this particular class symbol at runtime, but it was not found in the linked libraries.

---

2. **Root Causes of This Error**:
   - **Mismatch Between NDK Toolchains**:
     - You might be using an NDK version for compilation that differs from the environment at runtime. For example, newer NDK toolchains (e.g., Clang) have stricter compatibility requirements.
   - **Incorrect Linking Settings**:
     - Your `CMake` or `NDK-build` script might not include the correct **C++ standard library** (`libc++`, `libgnustl_static`, etc.).
   - **ABI Compatibility Issues**:
     - If your native library/application targets different **ABI architectures** (e.g., `armeabi-v7a` vs `arm64-v8a`), the runtime environment might not find the correct prebuilt libraries for your app.

---

3. **Common Solutions**:

   ### 1. Use the Correct STL Library
   - Modern NDK uses **`libc++`** as the default C++ standard library. Ensure your build references it.
   - Update your **`CMakeLists.txt`** or `Application.mk` to include the proper STL.
     For example:
     ```cmake
     # In CMakeLists.txt
     set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD 17) # Use C++17 or C++14
     set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD_REQUIRED ON)
     
     # Specify `libc++` as the standard library manually
     set(CMAKE_SHARED_LINKER_FLAGS "${CMAKE_SHARED_LINKER_FLAGS} -stdlib=libc++")

     ```

     Or in `Application.mk`:
     ```plaintext
     APP_STL := c++_static
     ```

   ### 2. Match NDK Version at Compile Time to System Runtime
   - Always use the **same version** of NDK for compiling and deploying your application.
     - Example: If debugging via Android Studio, go to `File > Project Structure > SDK Location > NDK Version` to verify the version.

   ### 3. ABI Compatibility
   - Ensure the compiled native libraries match the architecture your app targets.
     - For instance, if the app targets `armeabi-v7a`, ensure all linked native libraries are also compiled for the same ABI.
     - Update your `build.gradle`:
     ```gradle
     android {
         defaultConfig {
             ndk {
                 abiFilters "armeabi-v7a", "arm64-v8a" # Match your desired ABIs
             }
         }
     }
     ```

   ### 4. Clear and Rebuild:
   - Clean project files, delete cache, and recompile:
     - In Android Studio:
       - Go to **Build > Clean Project**
       - Then **Build > Rebuild Project**
     - Also, delete the `build/` folder if necessary.

   ### 5. Manually Include Required Symbols:
   - If feasible, reference the missing class explicitly in your code to ensure it is included during linking. For example:
     ```cpp
     #include <sstream>

     std::istringstream temp; // Forces linker to include `std::istringstream`
     ```

---

### Example: Configuring `CMakeLists.txt` for Proper Linking

Hereâ€™s a complete example of configuring a typical CMake script:

```cmake
cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.7)

# Indicate your project
project(MyNativeApp)

# Set C++ Standard
set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD 17)
set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD_REQUIRED ON)

# Add source files
add_library(
    MyNativeLib
    SHARED
    src/main/cpp/native-lib.cpp
)

# Link libraries
find_library(
    log-lib
    log
)

# Link against libc++ instead of GNU STL
set(CMAKE_SHARED_LINKER_FLAGS "${CMAKE_SHARED_LINKER_FLAGS} -stdlib=libc++")

target_link_libraries(
    MyNativeLib
    ${log-lib}
    c++ # Link libc++
)

```

---

### Optional Debugging Methods

1. **Check Which Library is Missing**:
   - Use the `readelf` or `nm` command (Linux):
     ```bash
     readelf -Ws libYourLibrary.so | grep 'ZTTNSt6__ndk'
     ```
     This allows you to inspect whether the symbol exists in your compiled binary.

2. **Inspect Runtime Logs**:
   - Use `adb logcat` to view detailed runtime logs and pinpoint the error.
