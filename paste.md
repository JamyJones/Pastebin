## Summary
**Pydub** is a simple and easy-to-use library in Python that enables audio processing tasks such as manipulating, analyzing, and exporting audio files.

---
**Explanation:**

**1**
Pydub is built on top of the `FFmpeg` library, which means it supports a wide range of audio formats, including WAV, MP3, and OGG.

**2**
Some of the common tasks you can perform with Pydub include:
- Loading and saving audio files
- Converting between audio formats
- Playing audio files
- Manipulating audio (e.g., cutting, splicing, mixing, and overlapping)
- Changing audio properties (e.g., volume, frame rate, sample width, and channels)
- Exporting audio files to different formats

**3**
Pydub uses simple and intuitive methods that make it easy to work with audio files in Python. It abstracts much of the complexity of audio processing, allowing you to focus on your specific tasks.

**Example:**

Hereâ€™s a basic example of how to use Pydub to load an audio file, adjust the volume, and export the modified audio:

```python
from pydub import AudioSegment

# Load an audio file
audio = AudioSegment.from_file("input_file.mp3")

# Increase volume by 5 dB
louder_audio = audio + 5

# Export the modified audio to a new file
louder_audio.export("output_file.mp3", format="mp3")
```

In this example:
- `AudioSegment.from_file("input_file.mp3")` loads the audio file.
- `audio + 5` increases the volume by 5 decibels.
- `louder_audio.export("output_file.mp3", format="mp3")` saves the modified audio to a new file.
