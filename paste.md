   - The Fenghuang is often depicted alongside the dragon, which symbolizes the emperor. Together, they represent the union of yin (Fenghuang) and yang (dragon) and are significant in marriage ceremonies, denoting harmony between husband and wife.

4. **Literary References**  
   - References to the phoenix in literature can be found throughout Chinese history, especially in classical texts that discuss harmony, morality, and the ideal ruler.
