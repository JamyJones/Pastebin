## Summary
To learn how V2Ray works, you'll want to explore its architecture, configuration, and the protocols it supports.

### Overview of V2Ray
V2Ray is a versatile network tool that helps users bypass internet censorship and improve privacy. It operates as a proxy server and supports various protocols, making it a popular choice for users seeking secure and anonymous internet access.

### Key Components
- **Core**: The main engine that handles all the operations of V2Ray.
- **Protocols**: V2Ray supports multiple protocols, including VMess, Shadowsocks, and more. Each protocol has its own use case and configuration.
- **Configuration**: V2Ray uses a JSON configuration file to set up its parameters, including inbound and outbound settings.

### How V2Ray Works
1. **Inbound Configuration**: This section defines how V2Ray receives traffic. You can specify the protocol (e.g., VMess) and the port it listens on.
   - Example: 
     ```json
     {
       "inbounds": [
         {
           "port": 10086,
           "protocol": "vmess",
           "settings": {
             "clients": [
               {
                 "id": "your-uuid",
                 "alterId": 64
               }
             ]
           }
         }
       ]
     }
     ```
   - **Explanation**: 
     - `port`: The port number where V2Ray listens for incoming connections.
     - `protocol`: The protocol used for incoming traffic (e.g., VMess).
     - `clients`: A list of clients allowed to connect, identified by a unique UUID.

2. **Outbound Configuration**: This section defines how V2Ray sends traffic out. You can specify the destination server and the protocol to use.
   - Example:
     ```json
     {
       "outbounds": [
         {
           "protocol": "vmess",
           "settings": {
             "vnext": [
               {
                 "address": "your-server-address",
                 "port": 443,
                 "users": [
                   {
                     "id": "your-uuid",
                     "alterId": 64
                   }
                 ]
               }
             ]
           }
         }
       ]
     }
     ```
   - **Explanation**:
     - `address`: The address of the server you want to connect to.
     - `port`: The port number on the server.
     - `users`: The credentials used to authenticate with the server.

3. **Routing**: V2Ray allows you to define rules for how traffic should be routed based on various criteria, such as destination IP or domain.
   - Example:
     ```json
     {
       "routing": {
         "rules": [
           {
             "type": "field",
             "outboundTag": "blocked",
             "ip": ["geoip:cn"]
           }
         ]
       }
     }
     ```
   - **Explanation**:
     - `rules`: A list of routing rules.
     - `outboundTag`: The tag for the outbound connection to use.
     - `ip`: Specifies which IPs to block (in this case, those from China).

### Practical Example
To set up a basic V2Ray server, you would:
1. Install V2Ray on your server.
2. Create a configuration file with the inbound and outbound settings.
3. Start the V2Ray service and connect using a V2Ray client.
