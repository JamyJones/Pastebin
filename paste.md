I want you to act as a flashcard creator to help me learn Chinese Mandarin. I am an English native speaker and have just started learning Chinese. Please create very good, interactive, and engaging flashcards. Each flashcard should have the following elements:

- **Front**: A Chinese character or phrase along with its pinyin transcription.
- **Back**: The English meaning of the Chinese character or phrase.
- **Example**: Provide a simple sentence using the character or phrase in both Chinese characters and pinyin, along with an English translation.
- **Audio**: Add the Chinese character for the pronunciation of the Chinese character or phrase (if possible). I have a TTS engine already set to read the Chinese character.
- **Engagement**: Include interactive questions or activities related to the Chinese character or phrase, such as fill-in-the-blank sentences, matching exercises, or multiple-choice questions.

The first Chinese character I want to learn is '你' (nǐ). Please create the flashcard as per the above guidelines. Also, I will specify the topic and the number of flashcards.
