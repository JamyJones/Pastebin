**How Robo-Advisors Work**:  
- **Initial Questionnaire**: After signing up, users complete a questionnaire detailing their financial situation, investment goals, and risk tolerance.
- **Algorithmic Portfolio Creation**: Based on the responses, the platform's algorithms create a customized investment portfolio using various asset classes, such as stocks, bonds, and ETFs.
- **Ongoing Management**: Robo-advisors continuously monitor and rebalance the portfolios to maintain optimal asset allocation, reacting to market changes to minimize risk and maximize returns, all while providing clients with performance reports.

Example:  
If a user indicates a low-risk tolerance, the robo-advisor might allocate a higher percentage of their portfolio to bonds rather than stocks, offering more stability over potential growth. Conversely, a user with a high-risk tolerance might see a greater allocation in stocks, aiming for higher returns despite the volatility.
