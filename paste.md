## Summary: Speed of a Jet <br>
---

**Explanation:**
The speed of a jet depends on the type of jet (military, commercial, or private), its purpose, and its design. Below are the different categories of jets and their typical speed ranges.

1. **Commercial Jets** (E.g., Boeing 737, Airbus A320):<br>
   Typically designed for passenger transport, commercial jets run at subsonic speeds to ensure fuel efficiency and comfort. These jets generally cruise at speeds of **500 to 600 miles per hour (805 to 965 km/h)** (approximately Mach 0.8, where Mach 1 equals the speed of sound).

2. **Private or Business Jets** (E.g., Gulfstream, Bombardier):<br>
   Business jets prioritize both speed and range. Many private jets, such as the **Gulfstream G650**, can cruise at speeds of around **600 to 700 miles per hour (965 to 1125 km/h)**, with some models capable of reaching near-supersonic speeds.

3. **Military Jets** (E.g., F-16, F-22):<br>
   Military jets vary widely in speed based on their roles (e.g., combat, reconnaissance). Supersonic jets like the **F-16 Fighting Falcon** can reach speeds of about **1,500 miles per hour (2,414 km/h)** (Mach 2+). Hypersonic jets and some experimental models can exceed Mach 5 (3,836 mph or 6,174 km/h).

4. **Supersonic Passenger Jets** (E.g., Concorde):<br>
   Not in widespread use anymore, the **Concorde**, a supersonic commercial passenger jet, had a cruising speed of approximately **1,354 miles per hour (2,180 km/h)** (around Mach 2.04).

5. **Experimental and Hypersonic Jets**:<br>
   Experimental jets like the **NASA X-43** have reached hypersonic speeds exceeding Mach 9.6, or **7,000 miles per hour (11,265 km/h)**. These are mostly in the testing stage and not typically used for regular purposes.

**Example:**  
- A commercial airline flight from New York to London takes about **7 hours on a Boeing 787**, traveling at an average speed of around **570 mph (917 km/h)**.
- Conversely, the Concorde made the same trip in about **3.5 hours** due to its supersonic speed.
