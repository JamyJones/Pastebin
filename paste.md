## **Do All Chrome Browsers Have V8 Embedded Within?** <br>
---

### Explanation:
1. **V8 and Google Chrome:**
   - **V8** is Google's open-source **JavaScript (JS) and WebAssembly Engine**. Its primary purpose is to execute JavaScript code inside the browser.
   - Google Chrome, as a product of Google, has the **V8 engine embedded by default**. V8 is a vital component of Chrome, ensuring high-performance JS execution and WebAssembly support.

2. **All Chrome Versions:**
   - As of all officially released versions of **Google Chrome**, they utilize the **V8 engine**. Whether you're using Chrome on desktop (Windows, MacOS, Linux) or mobile (Android, iOS), the V8 engine is integrated.
   - The engine is continuously updated and improves parallelly with Chromeâ€™s updates because **JavaScript performance** is a key feature for modern web browsing.

3. **Chromium-Based Browsers:**
   - Other Chromium-based browsers, like Microsoft Edge (recent versions), Brave, Opera, and more, also leverage the power of the V8 engine because theyâ€™re based on the **same Chromium engine** as Chrome.

### Why is V8 Embedded? 
- **Performance:** V8 converts JS code into machine code, allowing faster execution.
- **Web Compatibility:** Most modern websites heavily rely on JavaScript.
- **Integration:** V8 ensures Google services like YouTube, Gmail, and Google Docs run optimally on Chrome.
