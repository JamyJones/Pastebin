## Summary: Fixing the `CANNOT LINK EXECUTABLE` error caused by a missing or unresolved symbol<br>
This error indicates that the program cannot find the symbol `_ZTTNSt6__ndk119basic_istringstream...` during runtime. It typically occurs when the necessary runtime libraries or a compatible C++ STL implementation (e.g., libc++ or ndk-STL) are not properly linked or mismatched.

---

### Explanation:

#### 1. **Understanding the Error and Symbol**  
   - `_ZTTNSt6__ndk119basic_istringstream...`: This symbol is part of the C++ Standard Library, specifically related to `std::istringstream`. The `basic_istringstream` template processes input streams from strings, and the error points to an issue in resolving the corresponding STL implementation.
   - **Common Causes**:
     - **Missing or incompatible STL library**: You may be using a standard library (e.g., `libc++`, `libstdc++`, or NDK's STL) that is either not correctly linked or mismatched.
     - **ABI (Application Binary Interface) incompatibility**: The symbol name starts with `_Z`, hinting at C++ name mangling. ABI mismatches (e.g., different compilers, flags) could lead to this error.
     - **Android NDK version mismatches**: If you are building for Android using the NDK, the issue may stem from incompatible NDK versions or a missing STL library.

#### 2. **Fixing the Problem in an Android NDK Context**

If you are targeting an Android environment, here’s how to resolve this issue:

##### a. **Verify the STL Library Configured**:
Ensure that you are using a proper C++ Standard Library:
- In your `CMakeLists.txt` or `Android.mk`, specify which STL implementation to use. `c++_shared` is commonly preferred for modern Android development.

For **CMakeLists.txt**:
```cmake
# Example of enabling libc++ in your build
set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD 17)  # Ensure C++17 or compatible version for the library
set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD_REQUIRED ON)

set(CMAKE_SHARED_LINKER_FLAGS "${CMAKE_SHARED_LINKER_FLAGS} -stdlib=libc++")

# Link the C++ standard library
find_library(CPP_STL libc++_shared PATHS ${ANDROID_NDK}/sources/cxx-stl/llvm-libc++/libs)
target_link_libraries(your_target ${CPP_STL})
```

For **Android.mk**:
```make
# Specify libc++ (modern C++ library) in the Android NDK
APP_STL := c++_shared
```

---

##### b. **Align NDK Version**
- If using the Android NDK, ensure you are using a compatible or supported version of the NDK (r21 or later for libc++ support). Check your `ndkVersion` in the `build.gradle` file:
```gradle
android {
    ndkVersion "21.4.7075529"
}
```

---

#### 3. **Providing the Proper Runtime Libraries at Execution**
- If you require a shared standard C++ library, ensure that the runtime (`libc++_shared.so`) is:
  1. Bundled within the `libs`/`apk` folder.
  2. Properly loaded on the target device during runtime.

Ensure the native libraries (`.so` files) include the correct library by validating the symbols using a utility like `readelf`:
```bash
readelf -Ws libyourlibrary.so | grep basic_istringstream
```

---

#### 4. **When Using Other Compilers (e.g., Clang vs GCC)**
- Mismatched compilers or even compiler flags can cause ABI incompatibility. Ensure:
  - Consistent compiler toolchains across your dependencies and project.
  - Use `-std=c++17` or a relevant C++ standard across all compilers involved.
  - Check for proper name mangling using `nm` or `readelf` tools.

Example for Clang while building:
```bash
clang++ -std=c++17 -stdlib=libc++ -o your_program your_source.cpp
```

---

### Example:

Let’s fix the error by building a project with the correct NDK configuration:

**CMakeLists.txt**:
```cmake
cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.10)

# Set project name
project(FixSymbolError)

#
