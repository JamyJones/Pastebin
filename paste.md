## Summary
To get a real feel of hardware programming in C++ or C, you can use libraries like **hwinfo** for hardware information retrieval or **sysfs** for controlling GPIO hardware.

## Explanation
1. **hwinfo**: This is a cross-platform C++ library that provides an easy-to-use API for retrieving hardware information such as CPU, RAM, GPU, disks, and more. It supports multiple operating systems including Linux, Apple, and Windows. You can build and include this library in your project using CMake.

2. **sysfs**: For controlling GPIO hardware, you can use the sysfs interface, which allows you to access GPIO pins through the file system. This method is straightforward and can be used in both C and C++ programs.

## Example
Here's a simple example of how to use the sysfs interface to control a GPIO pin in C++:

```cpp
#include <fstream>

void set_gpio(int pin, bool value) {
    std::ofstream gpio_file("/sys/class/gpio/gpio" + std::to_string(pin) + "/value");
    gpio_file << (value ? "1" : "0");
    gpio_file.close();
}

int main() {
    set_gpio(17, true); // Set GPIO pin 17 to high
    return 0;
}
```
