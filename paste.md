## Summary: Browser Engine

---

**Explanation:**

A browser engine is a core component of web browsers responsible for rendering web pages. It interprets HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and other resources, then visually represents the content on the user's screen. There are several well-known browser engines, such as Blink (used by Chrome), WebKit (used by Safari), and Gecko (used by Firefox).

**1. Loading and Parsing**

When you enter a URL, the browser engine starts by loading the HTML document from the server. It then parses the HTML to build the Document Object Model (DOM), a tree-like structure representing the page's content.

---

**2. Style Processing**

After building the DOM, the engine parses the CSS, applies the styles to the DOM elements, and constructs a Render Tree. This tree represents how elements will be displayed, including their dimensions and styles.

---

**3. Layout**

In this phase, the engine calculates the exact position and size of each element on the screen based on the Render Tree. This process is also known as "reflow."

---

**4. Painting**

Once the layout is complete, the engine paints the content on the screen. It converts the Render Tree into pixels, ensuring everything is displayed accurately according to the styles and layout.

**Example:**

Let's say you visit a webpage with the following simple HTML and CSS:

HTML:
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="styles.css">
</head>
<body>
  <h1>Welcome to My Page</h1>
  <p>Hello, world!</p>
</body>
</html>
```

CSS (styles.css):
```css
h1 {
  color: blue;
  text-align: center;
}

p {
  color: green;
  font-size: 16px;
}
```

**Explanation:**

1. The browser engine loads the HTML and CSS files.
2. It parses the HTML to create the DOM, representing the `<h1>` and `<p>` elements.
3. It parses the CSS and applies the styles to the DOM elements, constructing the Render Tree.
4. It calculates the layout, determining that the `<h1>` should be centered and the `<p>` should have a font size of 16px.
5. Finally, it paints the content on the screen, displaying the header in blue and centered, and the paragraph in green.
