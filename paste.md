## Summary
To use the `amix` filter in FFmpeg without interfering with the volume levels of the input audio streams, it is important to understand how to set the appropriate parameters and options that control the mixing behavior.

### Understanding the `amix` Filter
The `amix` filter in FFmpeg is used to mix multiple audio streams into a single output stream. By default, this filter sums the volume of the inputs, which may result in clipping if the combined volume exceeds 0 dB. To prevent volume interference or clipping when using `amix`, consider these strategies:

1. **Setting the `inputs` Parameter**:
   - The `inputs` parameter specifies the number of audio inputs to mix. It's essential to set this correctly to ensure that the filter understands how many streams to handle.
   - Example syntax: `-filter_complex "amix=inputs=2"`. 

2. **Using the `weights` Option**:
   - To maintain desired volume levels of each input, use the `weights` option to scale the volume of each input stream individually.
   - Example: `amix=inputs=2:weights=1 1` mixes two inputs with equal weight. Adjust the weights to control how much each input contributes to the final mix, keeping in mind that the total levels should be balanced.

3. **Adding `-volume` Filters**:
   - You can also employ the `volume` filter on individual input streams to normalize volume levels before they meet at the `amix` filter.
   - Example: `-i input1.wav -i input2.wav -filter_complex "[0:a]volume=0.8[a1];[1:a]volume=0.8[a2];[a1][a2]amix=inputs=2"`.

4. **Setting Normalization**:
   - Normalization can be applied to prevent distortion. You can use an additional filter like `loudnorm` for loudness normalization.
   - Example: Using `(loudnorm)` before mixing might help maintain consistent volume.

### Example
```bash
ffmpeg -i input1.wav -i input2.wav -filter_complex "[0:a]volume=0.5[a1];[1:a]volume=0.5[a2];[a1][a2]amix=inputs=2:duration=first:dropout_transition=2" output.wav
```
- This command:
  - Takes two input audio files.
  - Normalizes their volumes to 50%.
  - Mixes them together without clipping.
