## Summary
Hashrate in bitcoin mining pools refers to the total computational power contributed by all miners in the pool to solve complex mathematical problems and validate transactions on the Bitcoin network.

## Explanation
1. **Definition**: Hashrate is the speed at which a miner's hardware can perform these calculations, measured in terahashes per second (TH/s) or gigahashes per second (GH/s).
2. **Importance**: Higher hashrate increases the chances of finding a block and earning rewards. In a mining pool, the combined hashrate of all participants is used to find blocks more efficiently.
3. **Distribution**: Mining pools distribute rewards based on the proportion of hashrate each miner contributes. This makes earnings more predictable compared to solo mining.

## Example
Imagine a mining pool with a total hashrate of 100 TH/s. If a miner contributes 1 TH/s, they would receive 1% of the pool's rewards.
