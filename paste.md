## Summary
How to use OpenCV to split an image into 5 images

---
**Explanation**:

### 1. Introduction to OpenCV
OpenCV (Open Source Computer Vision Library) is an open-source computer vision and machine learning software library. It contains more than 2500 optimized algorithms, including a comprehensive set of both classic and state-of-the-art computer vision and machine learning algorithms. To start working with OpenCV in Python, you need to install the OpenCV library.

### 2. Installing OpenCV
To install the OpenCV library in Python, use the following pip command:
```python
pip install opencv-python
```
This command downloads and installs the OpenCV library and its dependencies.

### 3. Reading an Image
First, you need to read the image using the `cv2.imread` function, which reads an image from a file:
```python
import cv2

image = cv2.imread('path_to_your_image.jpg')
```
- **cv2**: This is the OpenCV module.
- **imread**: This method loads an image from the specified file.
- **'path_to_your_image.jpg'**: Replace this with the path to your image file.

### 4. Splitting the Image
To split an image into 5 parts, you need to decide how to divide the image. Here, I'll provide an example of how to split an image vertically into 5 equal parts:
```python
import numpy as np

height, width, _ = image.shape
split_height = height // 5

images = []
for i in range(5):
    split_img = image[i*split_height:(i+1)*split_height, :]
    images.append(split_img)
```
- **np**: This is the NumPy module used for numerical operations.
- **image.shape**: Returns the dimensions of the image (height, width, number of color channels).
- **split_height**: Calculates the height of each of the 5 parts.
- **split_img**: Extracts the corresponding part of the image.

### 5. Saving the Split Images
Finally, you can save the split images using the `cv2.imwrite` function:
```python
for idx, img in enumerate(images):
    cv2.imwrite(f'part_{idx}.jpg', img)
```
- **enumerate**: Used to get both the index and the value in the loop.
- **cv2.imwrite**: Writes the image to a file.

**Example**:
Here is a full code example that reads an image, splits it into 5 vertical parts, and saves each part as a separate file:
```python
import cv2
import numpy as np

# Read the image
image = cv2.imread('path_to_your_image.jpg')

# Get the dimensions of the image
height, width, _ = image.shape
split_height = height // 5

# Split the image into 5 vertical parts
images = []
for i in range(5):
    split_img = image[i*split_height:(i+1)*split_height, :]
    images.append(split_img)

# Save each part
for idx, img in enumerate(images):
    cv2.imwrite(f'part_{idx}.jpg', img)
```
This code will result in 5 separate images named `part_0.jpg`, `part_1.jpg`, `part_2.jpg`, `part_3.jpg`, and `part_4.jpg`.
