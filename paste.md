## Summary: Why Static .deb Packages Are So Huge
---
**Explanation:**
---
**1. Inclusion of Dependencies:**
Static .deb packages often include all the dependencies required for the application to run. This means that instead of relying on shared libraries that are already present on the system, the package contains its own copies of these libraries. This ensures that the application will work regardless of the specific versions of libraries installed on the user's system, but it also increases the size of the package.
---
**2. Self-Contained Nature:**
Static .deb packages are designed to be self-contained. This means they include everything needed to run the application, including libraries, configuration files, and other resources. This approach simplifies installation and reduces the risk of compatibility issues, but it also results in larger package sizes.
---
**3. Redundancy:**
Since static .deb packages include their own copies of dependencies, there can be redundancy if multiple packages include the same libraries. This redundancy can lead to increased disk usage, as the same library may be included in multiple packages.
---
**Example:**
Imagine you have an application that requires a specific version of the JPEG library. If the system already has a different version of the library installed, a static .deb package will include its own copy of the required version to ensure compatibility. This duplication of libraries across different packages contributes to the overall size of static .deb packages.
