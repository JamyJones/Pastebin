## Summary
V2Ray is a versatile network tunneling tool and framework that is often used to bypass internet censorship and improve privacy online. It provides a way to create secure and anonymous internet connections.

V2Ray was developed as part of a project aimed at providing a better platform for various network protocols, especially useful in regions with restrictive internet policies.

1  
V2Ray serves as a **proxy server** framework, which means it can redirect internet traffic and mask the user's location. It supports multiple protocols including **VMess**, **Shadowsocks**, and **Socks**. Each of these protocols caters to different needs for privacy and performance.

2  
One of V2Rayâ€™s main features is its support for **customizable routing**. Users can define specific rules about how to route their traffic, allowing for highly personalized control over how and where their internet traffic is sent. This can include settings to bypass certain sites or ensure traffic goes through specific servers based on geographical location.

3  
In addition to acting as a proxy, V2Ray offers **encryption** options to protect user data. Encryption helps to secure the data being transmitted over the internet, making it much harder for third parties to monitor or intercept this information. It can also help prevent throttling and censorship from internet service providers.

Example: A typical use case of V2Ray involves setting it up on a server in a different country. Users then configure their device to connect to the V2Ray proxy, allowing them to access blocked websites in their location by routing their internet requests through the external server.
