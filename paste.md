## Summary: How Python's `for` Loop Works <br>
---<br>
Explanation:<br>
- The `for` loop in Python is used for iterating over a sequence (such as a list, tuple, dictionary, set, or string).
- It is preferred when you need to execute a block of code multiple times.
1<br>

The basic syntax of a `for` loop:
```python
for variable in sequence:
    # code to be executed
```
- **variable**: Represents the current element in the sequence.
- **sequence**: The collection of items (like a list or string) you want to loop through.

Example of a `for` loop iterating over a list:
```python
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
for fruit in fruits:
    print(fruit)
```
- **fruits**: A list of strings.
- **fruit**: The variable that takes the value of each item in the list during each iteration.
- **print(fruit)**: The action performed with each item. In this case, it's printing the item.

Example of a `for` loop iterating over a string:
```python
for letter in "hello":
    print(letter)
```
- **letter**: The variable that takes each character of the string "hello".
- **print(letter)**: Prints each character individually.
---<br>
The `for` loop can also be used with the `range()` function to loop a specific number of times:
```python
for i in range(5):
    print(i)
```
- **range(5)**: Generates numbers from 0 to 4.
- **i**: Takes each value from the range during each iteration.
- **print(i)**: Prints numbers 0 to 4.
