## Summary: What is `__aeabi_memcpy`?

`__aeabi_memcpy` is a low-level, architecture-specific memory copy routine that is part of the **ARM Embedded Application Binary Interface (EABI)**. It is often used in ARM-based systems for efficient memory copying tasks. Functions like this are typically included in compiled binaries by tools like GCC or Clang for ARM targets when optimizing code for small, embedded, or high-performance applications.

It performs a similar task to the standard C library function `memcpy`, but it is designed to better conform to ARM's EABI specifications, which are targeted at embedded systems and performance-critical applications.

## Explanation:

### 1: **What is ARM EABI?**

EABI (Embedded Application Binary Interface) is a specification for how binary files should behave in embedded systems (typically ARM). These specifications govern aspects like calling conventions, function names, and low-level library functions to ensure compatibility between compilers and tools on ARM devices.

- Functions starting with the prefix `__aeabi_` are low-level functions generated by ARM-compatible compilers.
- These functions, including `__aeabi_memcpy`, are optimized to work efficiently on ARM architecture by making use of specific instructions and memory-alignment features.

---

### 2: **Purpose of `__aeabi_memcpy`**

The `__aeabi_memcpy` function copies a block of memory from a source to a destination. Its purpose is similar to the standard `memcpy` function found in `<string.h>` in the C library. However, in this case:

- It is specifically optimized for ARM microprocessors.
- It is often called automatically by code generated by compilers to replace the generic `memcpy` for speed or to meet ARM's EABI standards.
  
The name `__aeabi_memcpy` is not meant to be directly called by the user. Instead, it is used internally by the compiler when it generates machine code.

---

### 3: **Relationship to `memcpy`**

Here’s how `__aeabi_memcpy` relates to `memcpy`:

- If you write a standard C program that calls `memcpy`, the compiler may replace calls to `memcpy` with `__aeabi_memcpy` (or a similar lower-level optimized routine) when compiling for ARM targets.
  
- In certain embedded environments, the standard library `memcpy` may actually just be an alias for `__aeabi_memcpy`.

- Since `__aeabi_memcpy` is part of the ARM runtime, it is typically included in libraries like `newlib` or compiler-specific runtime libraries like the GCC ARM runtime or ARM's compiler toolchain.

---

### 4: **How It Works**

The core functionality of `__aeabi_memcpy`:

- It takes three parameters:
  1. **Destination Pointer**: Where the data should be copied to.
  2. **Source Pointer**: The starting location of the data to copy.
  3. **Number of Bytes**: The number of bytes to copy.

- It uses highly optimized ARM assembly instructions to efficiently move blocks of memory, especially on devices with specific memory alignment requirements.

---

### 5: **Why Is It Used?**

1. **Performance**: Compilers like GCC replace standard memory copying routines with `__aeabi_memcpy` because it is optimized for ARM-specific hardware.
2. **Code Size**: Embedded systems often need smaller code footprints, and ARM's EABI routines are tailored for this.
3. **Standards Compliance**: Ensures that compiled binaries conform to the ARM EABI specifications.

## Example:

Here’s an example of how a C program might use `memcpy`, which could be replaced by `__aeabi_memcpy` during compilation:

```c
#include <string.h>

int main() {
    char source[] = "Hello ARM";
    char destination[20];

    // Standard memcpy call
    memcpy(destination, source, strlen(source) + 1);

    return 0;
}
```

When compiled for an ARM target (e.g., using GCC with `-mcpu` flag):

```bash
arm-none-eabi-gcc -mcpu=cortex-m4 -c example.c
```

The assembly output might show a call to `__aeabi_memcpy` instead of a generic `memcpy`:

```assembly
bl __aeabi_memcpy
```

---

## Notes for Developers:

1. If you encounter a linker error for `__aeabi_memcpy`, it usually means the ARM runtime library is either missing or improperly linked.
2. For debugging issues related to memory transitions, you can manually implement `memcpy` or validate the toolchain you’re using.
