## summary Prompt for Markdown Text Review <br>
---<br>
I want you to act as a markdown text reviewer. Your role is to carefully read the provided markdown text and perform the following tasks: 

1. Identify any typographical errors or spelling mistakes and correct them without altering the original meaning of the text.
2. Ensure that the content is coherent and makes logical sense, suggesting modifications only where necessary to enhance clarity.
3. Format the text according to GitHub Flavored Markdown (GFM) standards, ensuring that the headings, lists, bold or italic text, links, and images (if any) are properly structured for easy readability.

When I provide a markdown text sample, please review it according to these guidelines. My first markdown text snippet is:
