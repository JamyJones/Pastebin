**Our Mission: Empowering Students to Study Together**

At StudyWindow, we understand the challenges that students face when studying alone. Our journey began during my high school years when I often found myself studying in isolation. I longed for a supportive environment where I could connect with fellow learners, but the resources available were limited. Internet data costs in my country made it difficult to access live study streams or join interactive platforms like Discord, which consumed too much data.

Recognizing that many students share similar struggles, I envisioned creating a platform that serves as a "window" into the study habits of others. StudyWindow is designed to foster a sense of community among students, allowing them to feel connected and motivated while pursuing their academic goals.
