## Summary: Height of Mount Everest<br>
---

**Mount Everest**, the highest mountain in the world, stands at a towering height of **8,848.86 meters (29,031.7 feet)** above sea level. 

This measurement was officially announced in December 2020 following a joint survey conducted by China and Nepal, which used advanced satellite positioning, ground-penetrating radar, and other modern technology to measure the peak accurately.

Mount Everestâ€™s height was previously recognized as **8,848 meters**, but this new measurement adds 0.86 meters, likely owing to better technology and geological factors such as tectonic plate movement over time.
