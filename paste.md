## Summary: Addressing the "_ZTTNSt6__ndk119basic_istringstreamIcNS..." Error in an Executable on Android
---
### Explanation:
This specific error arises **when a native Android executable cannot find a required symbol in the underlying native C++ library (libc++ or ndk-stl-related namespaces mapping to `libstdc++`)**. It implies that the app or executable you are building or running relies on the **standard C++ stream classes (e.g., `std::istringstream`)**, but the symbols for these classes are either missing or incompatible with the runtime environment.

This is a common issue in Android development, especially when there are mismatches between:
1. **The Native Development Kit (NDK)** version you are using.
2. **The toolchain and libraries linked into the executable (e.g., libc++, libstdc++, libc++abi).**
3. **ABI (e.g., ARM-v7a, ARM64, x86, x86_64)** and the prebuilt libraries the executable expects.

Below are the key causes and solutions:

### 1 — **Understanding the Cause**
   - **Symbol `_ZTTNSt6__ndk1...`** indicates it's looking for **`libc++` symbols** specifically, indicating reliance on **LLVM's libc++ library** (not the older GNU STL or libstdc++).
   - Possible reasons why this can fail:
     1. **Older NDK version used**: Android NDK earlier than r18 has multiple `libstdc++` and `libc++` linking options, which often lead to conflicts.
     2. **Incorrect standard library linking**: The code may be compiled with `libc++`, but the runtime is linked against `libstdc++` or doesn't include `std::istringstream` symbol mappings.
     3. ABI mismatches, where prebuilt libraries are for a different architecture than the executable expects.

### 2 — **Solutions**
Below are recommended fixes depending on what you are working on (native C++ code, libraries, or applications):

---
#### A. **Verify Your NDK Version**
   - **Android NDK versions** before **r18** are deprecated and use older toolchains, which make modern `libc++` integration error-prone.
   - Ensure you are using **Android NDK `r18` (released in 2018) or later**. Most builds today require NDK versions from r21 and later.
   - Update your `ndkVersion` in your project files (`build.gradle`) to a modern release:
     ```gradle
     android {
         ndkVersion = "23.1.7779620" // or latest version
     }
     ```
---
#### B. **Link With `libc++` Instead of `libstdc++`**
   - Specify in your **CMakeLists.txt** or standalone `ndk-build` Makefile to use `libc++` rather than the deprecated `gnustl` or `libstdc++`.
   - Example configuration for **CMake**:
     ```bash
     # Project's CMakeLists.txt
     set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD 17)             # Use modern C++ standard
     set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD_REQUIRED ON)   # Explicit requirement on C++17

     add_library(native-lib SHARED native-lib.cpp)
     target_link_libraries(native-lib
         libc++
         libc++_shared                   # Ensure libc++ shared linking
         android
         log                             # Android-specific logging library
     )
     ```
   - If you're using an `Android.mk` file instead of CMake, explicitly set the STL library:
     ```makefile
     APP_STL := c++_shared # Prefer libc++ over gnustl
     ```

---
#### C. **Ensure Correct ABI and Architecture**
   - Android builds must explicitly target specific ABI configurations (e.g., `armeabi-v7a`, `arm64-v8a`, `x86`).
   - Confirm the prebuilt libraries you're relying on also target the same ABI as your executable.
   - Set in `build.gradle`:
     ```gradle
     android {
         defaultConfig {
             ndk {
                 abiFilters "armeabi-v7a", "arm64-v8a", "x86"
             }
         }
     }
     ```

---
#### D. **Rebuild and Check Libraries**
   1. **Force a clean rebuild** of the native code to ensure compatibility:
      ```bash
      rm -rf <project_dir>/build && ./gradlew clean assembleDebug
      ```

   2. If you're using any **third-party libraries**, confirm that the library was compiled with the same ABI and toolchain. Rebuild the library, if possible.

---
#### E. **Set Runtime Symbol Verification**
   During runtime, Android attempts to locate shared library symbols dynamically. Misconfigurations here can also cause symbol resolution failure. Ensure proper shared libc++ linkage:
   - Use `set(CMAKE_SHARED_LINKER_FLAGS "-Wl,--unresolved-symbols=ignore-in-object-files")` to debug.

---
### Example: Using `std::istringstream` Correctly in Android

Below is a minimal C++ example utilizing `std::istringstream` (related to your reported error):

```cpp
#include <sstream>
#include <iostream>
#include <string>

int main() {
    std::string input = "123 456 789";
    
    // Create an istringstream object to parse integers from a string
    std::istringstream iss(input);

    int number;
    while (iss >> number) {
        // Output each parsed number
        std::cout << number << std::endl;
    }

    return 0;
}
```

**CMakeLists.txt for compiling on Android**:
```cmake
cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.10.2)
project("istringstream_example")

add_library(
    native-lib
    SHARED
    native-lib.cpp
)

find_library(log-lib log)
target_link_libraries(
    native-lib
    libc++
    log-lib
)
```
